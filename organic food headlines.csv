The USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) provides everything you need to know about organic labeling. While there are several different organic labels, all product labels using the term require approval by a USDA-accredited certifying agent. Here are the most common areas of interest.

To be labeled organic:

Products are overseen by a USDA NOP-authorized certifying agent, following all USDA organic regulations, and produced without excluded or prohibited methods such as genetic engineering, ionizing radiation, or sewage sludge. All products use only allowed substances listed on the website below.

What about using the term “organic” or the “organic seal” on packaging?

A product probably needs to be certified organic to use the name, and it will need to be certified to put it on a retail display. The principal exemption applies to selling less than $5,000 annually.

The four categories of organic:

“100% Organic”

Raw, unprocessed, or minimally processed farm crops or all ingredients confirmed organic. Can use the organic label and the USDA-certified organic seal on the packaging.

“Organic”

It must contain a minimum of 95% organic ingredients. Up to 5% non-agricultural ingredients should be on the list AMS provides. Most likely, these ingredients are not produced organically. Can use the organic label and the USDA-certified organic seal on the packaging.

“Made with organic \_\_\_\_\_\_\_”

The product contains at least 70% organic ingredients and should detail constraints that prevented the other 30% from meeting organic requirements. Cannot use the organic label and the USDA-certified organic seal on the packaging.

“Specific Organic Ingredient Listings”

Specific organic ingredients can be listed for on labels of products containing less than 70% organic. Cannot use the organic label and the USDA-certified organic seal on the packaging.

For any other questions and further explanations, please visit the USDA AMS link below. ",1691612437.0,2,0
13,Seeking advice to revive a century-old family farm,organic,6,15m17a7,https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/15m17a7/seeking_advice_to_revive_a_centuryold_family_farm/,10,"My wife and I found out today, August 8, 2023, that we will inherit an eight-plus acre property in November. The land has been in her family for 95 years and has operated as a vegetable and flower farm with a roadside stand the entire time. We’d like to continue the tradition, but we need some guidance, as we also found out that it barely breaks even. 


We run the flower operation on 1/4 of an acre, while relatives grow produce on six acres. The operations are separate in terms of space and accounting, which is how we were blindsided by the lack of profits on the produce side. Our flowers are profitable.


The farm has never grown fruit, had animals, or even compost. For having only six farmable acres, the farm has been run conventionally without a thought given to long-term sustainability. For example, the soil is literally sand, tilled to the fine texture of a beach. Flowers and weeds grow well, but produce gets blossom end rot or does not reach full potential. 


Additional info, features, and concerns:



* We are in Wisconsin, zone 5b
* We are both 41 and have three kids under 8
* The property is a long rectangle, 300 feet east to west, 1300 feet north to south
* Suburban-type houses are on all sides, comprising 22 adjacent neighbors
* No irrigation 
* On a well, no city water or sewage 
* No fences, so deer and rabbits are constant problems
* Thrips, aphids, Japanese beetles, horn worms, and cabbage moth worms are constant problems 
* There’s a uninhabited single-story frame house with two beds/one bath built in 1890 that has a mold problem that can be smelled from outside 
* There’s a two car garage built in the 1950s that raccoons made their home in for many years
* There’s a pole barn built in 1960s that has a dirt floor, a caved in roof, and a sliding door that won’t shut
* There are five 48-foot long hoop houses (currently used to store tools and tractors)
* 2 acres of forest
* A section of a several mile long ravine runs west to east on the back side of property through the forested area
* There’s a 1986 John Deere 900HC tractor


This seems to be golden opportunity to create a proper farmstead—as in living there, putting things right, and making money; however, we don’t have much to spend and it can’t take decades. 


So, I am looking for detailed guides that specify low-cost, straightforward steps that will allow us to turn this worn-out land into something green, profitable, and beautiful. I want to get started the day we get the keys and never look back. Please, please help…and thank you!",1691545242.0,6,0

Penn State University researchers are among the first to take a comprehensive look at the long-term impact of organic honey bee pollination versus traditional methods. The study lasted three years, and the results were quite favorable for organic.

The team was made up of researchers and thirty experienced beekeepers. They tracked 300 honey bee populations on eight certified organic farms in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The scientists would listen to the beekeepers and the results. This would ensure that the study captured beekeepers' day-to-day challenges outside of a controlled environment. The beekeepers and the scientists were providing each other feedback.

Colonies were placed in one of the following categories: conventional management, organic management, and chemical-free management. The main difference between the groups is that hobbyists prefer chemical-free, while organic beekeepers generally intervene as little as possible. Most large-scale honeybee operations often intervene with chemicals and supplements to keep colonies alive.

The results for organic and conventional systems were almost identical. Both increased winter survival by 180%. There were no major survival issues between the two. Honey production was up 118% for organic and 102% for conventional. Parasites and pathogen levels were not materially different.

The results for organic production are promising. The scientists noted that the colonies' products could not be marketed as certified organic because this requires a 3-kilometer pesticide-free zone around the colonies. This is challenging to create in actual world production. Is this an area that can be addressed in the future?

Consumer demand for organic products surpassed $67 billion in 2022. The USDA listened to the challenges of reliance on imported organic feed and the time it takes to become certified organic. The recent turmoil and conflicts have shined an ever greater spotlight. Secretary Tom Vilsack announced a two-pronged approach to supporting and developing the domestic organic market to continue this rapid growth.

First, the new Organic Market Development Grant (OMDG) Program will issue $75 million in competitive grants. These grants can be used for various supply chain or production improvements, from processing to capacity to developing new consumer-facing products.

Second, the USDA has raised the cost share amount under the Organic Certification Cost Share Program or OCCSP. This program helps organic producers cover organic certification costs.

*“As USDA works to help make our nation’s food system more resilient and create more options for producers and consumers, we recognize the important role the organic industry can play in expanding opportunities for value-added agriculture, strengthening supply chains, and generating revenue for farmers,” Vilsack said. “For many farmers, the transition period before attaining organic certification can be cost-prohibitive, so USDA is also helping mitigate the risk involved for farmers who want to be able to grow and market organic crops.”*",1685090215.0,13,0

Here is goes:

Non-organic food (especially in worst cases of non-organic gardening) is grown either without soil or in soil fed with artificial fertilizers, slime, chemical compounds, factory wastes that haven't been broken down by the earth and its microflora. The result is the big blown and often imperishable and tasteless (apart from sweetness) vegetables that are partially made from indigestible, non-living matter. On top of that, the inorganic matter in them is often charged with toxins and unstable, polluted energy accumulated during growth, harvesting, storage, production and transportation.

Our digestive system doesn't have the capacity to break down non-living matter, as the result, the spleen runs out of Qi trying to separate those little bits that are digestible, while the rest goes into waste and is deposited as dampness and phlegm in the body, because the body doesn't have enough energy to evacuate all that waste.

Any active toxic substances, pesticides, chemicals, irradiation etc. accumulated in that non-organic food, cannot be just let alone and moved out from the body as is, as they are too volatile. They have to be enveloped into a thick Yin layer of Damp first. As the Spleen becomes Qi deficient and unable to cope with all that waste, and it would damage the body if the Spleen tries to separate those toxins from the matter, they just get deposited in the body until better times come, usually starting around the waist and hip area and spreading into other vital organs and then the rest of the body. We might be eating more but we keep depleting our life energy and create blockages in energetic pathways as well as in bodily liquid circulations.

The large intestine suffers the most perhaps, as all those inorganic deposits create a thick layer around its walls preventing healthy energy and blood circulation, building a perfect environment for unhealthy, non-human beneficial microflora to thrive within it. As its function weakens, all body organs suffer from being unable to fully cleanse and restore their functions. The wastes in the large intestine become reabsorbed by the body as its energy to contain and eliminate the waste efficiently is compromised.

The further it goes the worse it gets until we start carefully looking onto what we eat and how much, and listen to our body response to all that.

When that unhealthy inorganic microflora in our guts and organs accumulates to a substantial degree, it has the power to influence our body and mind, thoughts and desires, creating cravings and needs that would continuously feed that microflora and that would reduce the healing, restorative powers of the body, mostly through direction of all the energy away from the body and into the brain through all sorts of external or internal stimuli, suppression of body emotions and expressions and through consuming unhealthy food and information.

We want to make sure that the Yin we nourish our body with and the Yang that gives it vital animating energy, both are balanced and come from the cleanest, natural sources, grown with love and care for the planet and humanity. When we eat, we need to lower our mind into the abdominal area, not superficially checking on it here and there, but steadily keeping it in the lower body. When we see colors and taste flavors of the food, we need to be able to connect, without thinking, comparing or judging, these flavors, aromas and colors with the feeling we get from the body. Eating like that we will know intuitively what and when our body needs, to stay healthy and vibrant.

I hope it is helpful and is not completely out of the context!",1642808484.0,2,0

Swan & Stacey Colino (2020) which is about how toxic chemicals including endocrine disrupting chemicals are damaging our health including our sexual health. I am brand-new to this subject and I was shocked by how much harm we are doing to ourselves. As I was reading the book I was noting down recommendations by the authors for how to avoid toxic chemicals with an eye towards writing some kind of list I could share with my family & close friends.

After reading the book I felt like a ""starter list"" would be best to focus on ""Do's & don't's"" as the easiest entry point. Then if people are interested enough, they can choose to take the next step of finding healthy natural organic alternatives.

So below is my starter list of ways for people to avoid toxic chemicals. **I would love your feedback and critique if you have time. I am especially interested about whether any of my suggestions below are wrong or out of date.**

Thank you

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* Only use cleaning products that have ingredients you can identify e.g. water, vinegar, baking soda, essential oils. Look for home-made cleaner recipes online.
* Don't use or purchase carpets, indoor mats, or rugs that are treated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Good alternatives to carpets include solid wood, tile, cork or natural linoleum flooring
* If you do choose to have carpet, opt for natural materials
* When selecting area rugs, choose wool or natural plant materials. Look for materials such as jute, seagrass or sisal, and natural rubber nonskid padding.
* Use low-VOC adhesives to install carpets
* Regardless of flooring, use doormats and don't wear shoes indoors. Taking off your shoes will prevent tracking in dirt and pollutants.
* Avoid stain or waterproofing treatments on your carpets
* Vacuum all carpets and rugs thoroughly using a machine with a HEPA filter at least once a week
* Don't use shoe polishes and carpet cleaners containing trichloroethylene (TCE)
* Wipe surfaces of dust using a wet cloth or mop
* Don't use plastic containers for food storage. Use glass, stainless steel, ceramic, or porcelain containers with tops or aluminium foil.
* Never reheat food in plastic in the microwave. Transfer it to a plate or a bowl.
* Don't use nonstick cookware. Switch to cast-iron pots & pans or stainless steel. Also consider ceramic, porcelain, anodized aluminium cookware, or glass bakeware.
* Only drink water that has already been filtered for toxic chemicals & microplastics
* Use glass or stainless steel for drink bottles
* Avoid black plastic cooking utensils
* Don't use a plastic reusable cup or a bamboo reusable cup. Choose a stainless steel, ceramic, porcelain or glass reusable cup.
* Eat a home-cooked fresh food diet. Choose fresh ingredients such as loose fruit and loose vegetables. Buy from bulk stores where you can refill your own containers.
* Buy organic seasonal locally-grown food
* if you are unable to buy organic food 100% of the time, avoid eating non-organic products which contain the highest amounts of pesticide residues such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and apples
* Avoid packaged food or drink such as plastic bottles, food wrapped in plastic wrap, takeaways in fast food containers, food packaged in greaseproof lining, canned foods, packaging labelled with recycling codes 3 or 7
* Reduce your consumption of canned food
* Don't eat fast food
* Don't eat microwave popcorn
* Don't drink out of cans
* To avoid exposure to dioxins (a harmful chemical) eat a vegan diet. More than 90% of human exposure to dioxins is through food, mainly meat and dairy products, fish and shellfish.
* If you do want to eat meat, avoid processed meat. Choose hormone-free beef and hormone-free dairy.
* If you do want to eat fish, choose fish with the lowest toxic chemical content
* Use period products that are plastic-free, unscented, and labelled ""totally chlorine free (TCF)""
* Where possible use reusable period products such as silicon cups, reusable pads, reusable tampon applicators, and period pants/period underwear
* Don't use anti-mold paints in the home
* Don't wear face masks and other personal protective equipment containing nanographene and other nanoparticles
* Buy non-toxic sunscreen and non-toxic baby sunscreen
* Buy children's toys that are labelled phthalate-free, PVC-free, BPA-free, BPS-free, and BPF-free
* Avoid children's toys that smell strongly of chemicals or are heavily scented.
* Avoid soft plastic children's toys, as these can contain endocrine disruptors like phthalates.
* Choose natural rubber children's toys
* If a children's toy is painted or treated with varnish or other coatings, make sure it is non-toxic, free from lead, and meant for children
* When furnishing the playroom, include natural materials whenever possible. Choose wooden tables and chairs, with cushions if desired, and baskets, rather than plastic bins, to hold children's toys and art supplies
* Unpack any new children's toy and leave it outdoors to let some of the hazardous chemicals evaporating
* Buy solid wooden children's toys with as few glued parts as possible
* Buy unvarnished and painted children's toys wherever possible or watch out for non-toxic and natural finishes
* Don't buy school uniforms that have PFAS-based stain resistance (check the labels before you buy)
* Don't use face paint with toxic ingredients on children
* Buy nappies that are chemical free. Opt for organic cotton, fragrance-free, and reusable nappies
* Don't use personal care or beauty products that contain toxic chemicals. Buy certified 100% organic products packaged in glass or ceramic jars that are labelled paraben free, fragrance free, and perfume free.
* Use PFAS-free dental floss
* When buying abroad or online, be aware the same product can contain harmful chemicals depending on where you buy it
* If you live outside the EU, choose products that are sold in the EU. The EU has the strictest chemical regulations in the world, and so these cosmetics may have fewer harmful chemicals in them.
* Don't use nail varnish and nail remover
* Don't purchase or use products with the ingredients 'fragrance' or 'parfum'
* Don't use vinyl shower curtains
* Don't use scented candles or antibacterial soap
* Don't use air fresheners
* Purchase items & products that are free of PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers) and other harmful plastics
* Buy products free of free of flame-retardant chemicals and toxic adhesives (such as those containing formaldehyde)
* Choose natural-wood tables and cabinets that are made without synthetic wood or particleboard
* Buy organic-cotton mattress pads, not ones with the plastic barriers that will release their own chemicals into the air
* Don't buy clothes that are treated with fluorinated chemicals called PFAS to make them waterproof or stain resistant
* Don't use synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and synthetic fertilisers
* Use organic fertiliser (home-made or store-bought) e.g. use grass clippings as fertiliser on your lawn
* Avoid handling till receipts as much as possible
* Don't put till receipts in the recycling bin – because they can contaminate the entire recycling stream

&#x200B;

* Check suspect ingredients in hair sprays, nail polishes, hair dyes, shampoos, body wash products, body creams, moisturisers, make-ups, soaps, lipsticks, deodorants, antiperspirants, cleaning products, and fragrances against the SIN List ([https://sinlist.chemsec.org/](https://sinlist.chemsec.org/)).

&#x200B;

* As a rule it's best to avoid products labelled as having anti-microbial properties
* Use mobile apps to identify toxic chemicals: In Germany, France and the UK, you can use apps to identify cosmetics containing chemicals that you should avoid. In Germany, use Tox Fox, in France use Clean Beauty, and in the UK try Giki Badges ([https://badges.giki.earth/](https://badges.giki.earth/)).

I'm a sustainable agriculture graduate student, and I've been taking several classes this semester on organic agriculture and horticultural systems.  I've decided to write my term paper on biochar production and application in organic farms...

It seems like biochar could easily be organically certified in the US depending on the biomass feedstock used and the process of pyrolsis, but for some reasons I can't find any sources explicitly stating that biochar is allowed.

In the EU, it looks like biochar was only recently allowed on Organic farms:

[https://pyreg.com/biochar-approved-for-organic-farming-throughout-the-eu/](https://pyreg.com/biochar-approved-for-organic-farming-throughout-the-eu/)

This makes me question its use in the United States.  I feel like I've scoured the web, but if someone could guide me to a website or publication that talks about the legal usage of biochar in organic ag. in the US, that would be amazing.

I never got allergies never got hurt never had got sick or had colds not even stomachaches. Then I went to college I started eating out changed my diet completely by eating pizza fries and a lot of junk food. Basically the American diet which was eating a lot of processed and fried food. I used to have an Indian diet with an emphasis of lots of organic fresh fruits and veggies everyday with rice and naan thanks to my mom. I slowly started to see my health detoriating in college though. I developed allergies got a kidney infection twice and even got an allergic reaction so bad I had to be hospitalized overnight. The doctor at the ER said I should see an allergist. I did and the allergist said I was allergic to everything like grass to every kind of nut. I was shocked, I’ve never been allergic to anything how can I be all of a sudden allergic to every nut there is and even grass when I’m a soccer player ?!! It got so bad that I felt dizzy and felt like I couldn’t get up for 10 days. Then I saw the doctor and she said I had acid reflux and that I shouldn’t worry and it’s completely normal. At this point I was like WHAT THE HELL why am I getting such bad health problems when I’m only 21. I dugged deeper into why my health was getting so bad and I realized it was because of eating processed toxic foods that caused my acid reflux and allergies. Then covid hit and I got back home to eating my moms cooking. Now I barely have acid reflux symptoms and I’m doing okay. But this ignited a passion that in me to end this horrid toxic food and to help people to preserve their health and not have to go through horrific bad health experiences like I have. This toxic food turned a completely healthy young adult like me to a person with a lifelong disease like acid reflux. So I started Green Club a website where we only sell non-toxic organic food! No artificial bad stuff! As I go on this journey to encourage people about eating good organic food, I’d like to you to join in too! If you support me and my cause shop greenclub.io it shows that just like me you care about your health and only want the best for yourself.

An alternative to conventional gardening is organic weed prevention. But the question of why you should do organic things is still up in the air.

A garden is a lovely thing to have. It also provides an area for rest and refreshment, aside from the fact that it adds splendor to your place. Similarly, a vegetable garden is also helpful. It can not only offer additional income; it can also enhance the health of your family.

There are many reasons why you'd like your yard to have a garden. It doesn't matter what kind, as long as the stuff you want from it is there. Yet again, although you have managed to have an attractive lawn, you may encounter some issues.

Weeds are only one of the few problems you may encounter with gardening. They are undesirable grasses that can grow on your lawn anywhere. While some of them may look beautiful, it is not recommended to raise them with your plants, though.

Different ways of killing weeds exist. You can purchase weed spray, fertilizer for grass killer, or follow organic weed prevention. Although there may be effective lawn weed killers, some of them are still discouraged.

The best and most advisable way to kill weed so far is by preventing organic weed. Rather than chemicals, it is merely the use of organic weed preventers. But why go for an option like this?

&#x200B;

**Here are some of the reasons why you should consider killing unwanted grass in your garden in an organic way:**

&#x200B;

**1)** Be an active ecologist. Due to its relevance to anti-pollution and soil pollution, the main reason why organic living is promoted is. That is why your most significant contribution to the most important and most prominent campaign of our time is to use natural products.

**2)** Your plants' healthy soil. If there is one thing in your garden that you have to take care of, that would be the soil. To grow beautiful and healthy plants, it is essential to have healthy soil.

**3)** When too many chemicals are put into it, the soil's natural nutrients are depleted. Weed roundup when this occurs; unhealthy plants and crops and unattractive flowers are all you'll have.

**4)** On the other hand, you can be sure that controlling unwanted grass will no longer be an issue when you have healthy soil. This is because some of their growth will be able to control the plants.

**5)** Avoid risks to health. Conventional fertilizers are packed with hazardous chemicals for our health. People exposed to these chemicals may develop ailments attributed to the use of these chemical weed killers in the long run.

**6)** Support from the government. Nowadays, because organic living is highly recommended and encouraged by governments and international organizations, you can only expect it to be beneficial.

&#x200B;

First, to market your products, you don't have to spend too much money. Governments are allocating budgets to the marketing of organic products and products. That is why they purchase them whenever people see organic products.

Moreover, governments are now providing areas where [organic products](https://www.saansmart.com/) are displayed in supermarkets and other market areas. They sometimes even encourage those businesses and farms that use organic products. Because of this, individuals would quickly know which item to buy and where to buy it.",1606677413.0,2,0

I'm VERY new to Organic products though, but I really want to make the jump for multiple reasons.

For example, the balance of omega 3/6 in beef products from pasture vs grain feeding seems to be very important.  I really think animals should eat what they've evolved to eat, not what makes them fat and best to sell.

&#x200B;

So this is a bit of a double question.  I think I've figured out beef, but what should I look for in chicken, pork, lamb?   Is ""just organic"" enough with these?

&#x200B;

That being in mind, does anyone know if Waitrose's products sound suitable for me?  Their beef seems to be pasture fed 100% - "" . Cattle come from farms in England, Scotland and Wales, graze on organic pastures and are reared on an organic forage based diet. ""

They also look to have a good range of fruit, veg and other products, thus making is easier for me to manage it all.

&#x200B;

I'm sure some will suggest ""local farmers markets"", but that isn't an option in the area I live as everything is ""lowest posible cost"" and I wouldn't trust anything to be what it says it is.

My experience of our local supermarkets is that they say they have organic produce, but there's never actually any in stock when I come to order.  Which I strongly suspect is due to the issue I just mentioned - ""why stock something that the locals won't buy?""",1602761161.0,5,0

The milk is definitely fresh, open just after bringing it from the shop with a sell-by date for at least 7 days.

I try to shake the milk to get it to mix normally together, but this seems to have no effect. The milk tastes fresh, all tough the flakes have some psychological effects on my reception of the taste.

Is this normal?

For more details of the origin of the milk, I live in Germany (Munich) and the milk as organic alpine milk from Molkerei Berchtesgadener Land. They produce one of the best milk and other dairy products I've ever tasted so I'm not worried about these flakes, just curious why this happens and why I can't seem to shake the fat back into the rest of the milk. The milk is in a brown glass bottle with.

602,Sprouts - The Healthy Myth,organic,12,hrr34a,https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/hrr34a/sprouts_the_healthy_myth/,9," 

I  was once a believer in ""healthy"" mainstream grocery stores, not  anymore. Sprouts, and other stores like it, have done so much damage to  the health of so many people. People shop there thinking everything in  the store is organic, locally sourced Non-GMO, pesticide free, etc. None  of this is true.

1. Over 90% of their products are not organic, you can find GMO's on just about every shelf.
2. The produce section is a haven for pesticides.
3. Their organic produce section is one of the smallest sections in the store, none of it locally sourced.
4. They acquire real organic stores and then turn them into just another store to buy more poisoned food.
5. They refuse to take the initiative to label GMO foods, that would be bad for profits.
6. Their cage free eggs are not cage free, there are no real mass produced cage free eggs.
7. They  are not a ""Farmers Market"", they are just another grocery store that  sells poisonous products from all over the world produced by people  making less than slave wages.

What  Sprouts is doing is incredibly deceitful and dangerous. People load up  their carts with what they think are safe and healthy foods, they are  not. I walked out of the store a few weeks ago after I realized what  they were really selling. I went to Von's, a chain store, and purchased  my real organic products and paid a whole lot less. You will find far  more organic food at just about any large grocery store than you will  find at Sprouts. Both stores sell organic and GMO food, why pay more to  get less?

615,Say Yes to Organic Food!,organic,0,hjseoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/hjseoh/say_yes_to_organic_food/,0,"“Natural vs Artificial” “What is Healthy and what is not” Are organic foods healthier than conventional foods? Do they give you a longer life, help build better immunity, have more nutrients and antioxidants than other conventional foods? And looking at the broader picture is organically grown produce better for the environment.

Interestingly, recent studies show that “Millennials and younger members of Generation X tend to be the biggest users of organic foods, and much more likely than average to agree that they especially look for organic or natural foods when they shop”. With that being said, undoubtedly, Organic food/plants are grown in a healthier way, thus making it safer to consume. In addition, organic foods are less toxic & keep a greater amount of nutrients intact as compared to conventionally grown foods. However, it’s a healthy lifestyle and overall food choices that we make that matter the most

&#x200B;

[Say Yes to organic food!](https://preview.redd.it/masjc0so8e851.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bf7e6fe8d7006ae05e3e995810025a376d0c489)

**Without further ado, lets list 5 Top benefits of consuming Organic foods:**

1. **Fewer Pesticides:** Organic food don’t contain preservatives that make it last longer and/or residue traces of fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides that are used otherwise

2. **Organic food is fresher:** Organic produce is often produced on smaller farms near where it is sold. It is harvested when ripe and thus fresher and full of flavor. To shop for a full range of organic products in the UAE, visit [www.ducem.ae](http://www.ducem.ae/)

3. **Good for the environment:** Organic farming practices reduce pollution, conserve water, reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy. They thus are environment friendly. Farming without pesticides is also better for nearby birds and animals as well as people who live close to farms

4. **Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts:** Feeding livestock animal byproducts increases the risk of mad cow disease (BSE) and the use of antibiotics can create antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Organically-raised animals are given more space to move around and access to the outdoors, which helps to keep them healthy

&#x200B;

Check out gluten free product by [Doganay Black Carrot juice](http://tdl.ae/doganay.html)!

5. **Organic meat and milk are richer in certain nutrients:** Results of a recent European study shows that levels of certain nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, were up to 50 percent higher in organic meat and milk than in conventionally raised versions.

One common concern with organic food is the cost. Organic foods typically cost more than their conventional counterparts. Higher prices are due to more expensive farming practices. However, there is no doubt that organic foods are better than non-organic food products because of the vitamins and nutrients present in them. They definitely keep us healthy and active throughout our lives",1593674020.0,0,0

We create a resistant GMO but micro-level organisms interact with that genetically modified change as well and we can't control the change that comes in them. Then the organisms that eat those organisms can get a change as well that we can't control.... And the changes keep going to different organisms in the food chain. Everything is connected. Anything could happen. Gene manipulation is a very dangerous technology in my eyes.

We are already headed towards genetically changing insects etc. as well. Scientists changing one organism to wipe out another that is causing problems is already happening. All it would take is one bad change to an insect and once it starts multiplying that could lead to a nightmare...

From the beginning farmers have been farming organic and life has continued without pesticides or GMOs. When you try to take out insects/pests etc. evolution comes into play and you make them stronger because they're forced to grow and adapt. So at a micro-level changes start happening. The organisms becomes stronger then you have to make another pesticide/GMO that's stronger etc.... It does not seem smart to rapidly evolve pests etc. with pesticides and resistant GMOs.

I had minimal experience in this field, which was known, I do not have any knowledge in nutrition and have not completed my bachelors degree - all this information was known . So most data was secondary research - few articles of nutritional information came from the suppliers, after I begged that it was unethical not to give correct nutritional information to the buyer .The company required me to just find nutritional data online, or copy other online companies nutritional data - often times they told me to refer to amazon, or other online organic stores and just copy random nutritional data - often combining data from multiple products - since it did not matter and no buyer was actually going to be looking; I found this peculiar as the company’s only original point was they were putting a nutritional label in the front and not the back. No actual testing on the physical product being sold - as it was too expensive for the company to do such testing, they spent more time on finding good looking packaging than they did on the food they were selling . While I did argue that it was unethical to publish and advertise false data, the company and employees said all foods are “about” the same, so it does not truly matter. To appear appealing, the company required that general facts be googled about a similar product and those facts be highlighted, and connected to the nutritional data table they were providing. Often times the nutritional values were so negligibly small as compared to RDA, that it was not worth mentioning, however these one liner were sent to a nutritionist who approved the single fact being marketed. The company continued to market false data, in a sham to appear transparent and relevant.

The issue with falsifying and providing random nutritional data, are the health implications of such actions. There could be serious hypersensitivity reactions, health reactions that lead to death.

&#x200B;

My wife and I were at the store and saw eggs on sale, but couldn't figure out which ones were better. We saw one that said it was organic free roam, but the other one said it was grass fed. 

We picked up the grass fed ones, even though they weren't organic, because the way I thought about it was if the chickens are grass fed, they're roaming the field and eating what they should be. The organic ones just mean they're not in a cage, but they're fed organic feed. 

Plus, the grassfed ones displayed how many chickens were on each lot, so it seemed more like they were natural eggs as opposed to manufactured eggs.",1584032014.0,2,0
