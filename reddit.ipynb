You see, there is no scientific evidence that those organics have more nutrients, are safer nor that they add deliciousness, it was simply grown without the chemicals like pesticides or fertilizers, just the way our grand grand parents used to do. \\n\\nIn order to compensate for the lack of plant nutrients coming from chemical fertilizers (these are pure, sterile compounds), organic farmers use MANURE, lots of manure. could come from cows, pigs, chicken, or whatever is available since there is no chemical. With manure come antibiotics, and pathogens like salmonella if chicken manure is applied, and many of these vegetables are supposed to be eaten raw.  Chicken manure is good for leafy vegetables, because of the high content of Nitrogen, think of this when giving your kids that nice organic iceberg lettuce salad.\\n\\nThere is no way for the organic farms to supply all the produce required nowadays, and the population is growing non stop, so the prices will go up and up, so please consider studying a bit about the production and think, instead of following the herd.',\n",

I’ll finally get proper testing and treatment.\\n\\nI’ve been turned away by many doctors, simply told to just take birth control and come back when I want to have a baby. I fought tooth and nail to get on metformin and spiro two years ago and eventually just got it online and then asked doctors to refill and they did only because I already had the prescription. \\n\\nYet even with daily exercise, a back and forth between keto and lowcarb I still have a bmi of 34, always tired and I can tell my symptoms are worsening and my hair yet again falling out.\\n\\nI was very hopeful that maybe they would thoroughly check my hormones, fasting insulin and get me on a GLP-1 medication. When I’ve been tested before they’re like “yup you have elevated testosterone and insulin resistance, bye”. I got diagnosed at 19 because desperate to get the weight off I went to a bariatric surgery seminar and a concerned surgeon after the interview about my pretty healthy lifestyle sent me to a gynecologist feeling something else was going on. I was too big for how young I was and eating veggies and exercising. The gyno looked at me and said “you’re fat because you have PCOS”. That was it. No advice, no meds, no support. \\n\\nThis new doctor instead of listening denied any medication changes and went on a spiel about pesticides causing my metabolic dysfunction, adrenal fatigue and I really should be eating organic food and organic bread instead of regular to heal my PCOS. (I don’t even eat bread and I told her this).\\n\\nLike organic quinoa is really going to change my IR, and all of other severe issues. \\n\\nI was very open about my symptoms, my knowledge, my desperation to get to a normal weight.

Looking close up the whole pallet was infested with these little bugs (looks similar to rust brown flour beetles), after opening some boxes we could see a lot of these bugs crawling through the apple. This pallet had been up there apparently since last year and from what I saw the best before was September last year. \\n\\nInstead of throwing this out the boss put it all in chest freezers to kill the bugs and now we have to screen every box for bugs before putting it in the muesli. By screening I mean that we have to lay it out on a table and pick out the bugs. I tried to make the point that it won\\'t guarantee that there won\\'t be bugs in peoples food, to which the boss replied it\\'s normal for organic food to have bugs in it.\\n\\nWhen I tried talking about the quality of the bug infested apple and I\\'m not willing to eat the apple to test it\\'s quality so why are we putting it in peoples food, I pretty much got a response of \"That\\'s just your own mental feelings and thoughts about it, it\\'s normal to have bugs in organic food\".\\n\\nI don\\'t have that much experience in working with organic foods, so I\\'m starting to doubt myself but at the same time still don\\'t feel ok with putting in peoples food.\\n\\nJust wanted other peoples thoughts cos I feel like I\\'m going crazy',\n",

So it should not require that much effort to grow food products, and then sell them as it is.\\n\\n#### Why Organic Foods Are More Expensive?\\n\\nBut organic foods are more expensive, because of various reasons and one of the reasons is that **you need to have some certification and for their certification, you have to pay the extra amount to get that** [**USDA**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture) **organic label.** And as a result, you pay more price for that. That’s one of my understandings.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iao1985322va1.jpg?width=495&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6187a379b2fdc265f6036a97ad312ac5ad552c2\\n\\nBut then, **you can also try and look for people who are growing locally and the best example is farmers market** in almost all the states here. And take food from the local farmers, local growers and then that food should have more natural values than values induced in the food in the form of chemicals or pesticides or manure or. **Food is grown on its terms and whatever time it takes in growing and whatever form or shape it has that is what is the organic nature of food**.\\n\\nSo, sometimes you see in the stores, the food looks beautiful, you know all the tomatoes are the same size. And bananas look similar alike while when you look at a tree plant it has variation in its product. So, the things may not be that good looking, but you go for the looks of the food, or you should go for the nutritive value of the food that is what is important.\\n\\n### When You Are Buying Food, Do You Know How To Identify ORGANIC Food?\\n\\n**One important tip which I learned is that when you look for organic food.** It always best to check the stickers on the products on the vegetables and the fruit. I**f the sticker is starting with the number nine, so that means it is organic produce. And if it is starting with number four then it is conventional produce.** And then once you take food whether it is organic or inorganic, the longer you keep it in the refrigerator and you end up eating dead food which is now deprived of its original life force.\\n\\nSo food does have enzymes, juices, and another thing which I will always like to mention, it has life energy. T**he moment you pluck it from the plant or the tree. It is separated from the life energy and now it is dying slowly**. So the more you keep it out longer you keep it in the refrigerator, So that it doesn’t perish otherwise it will perish. So less lifeforce it has.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6hp915a422va1.jpg?width=558&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24d2d2585459b41315bec9c7609e917ebc9312a3\\n\\n### Using The LIFEFORCE Of The Food In Its Original Form Will Nourish You\\n\\nFood is a natural resource that just brings the life force straight on. **So keep it like that and use that lifeforce of the food in its original form and then it nourishes you**. So I wanted to touch base on organic and conventional food. What is the difference and why is the price high? And how can you go around and take food from the local growers. And sometimes you know, I have seen neighbors exchanging grown food with each other. So look for easy access to this good nutritive food and then change your habits. Moving from organic, inorganic or conventional food to organic or natural [holistic](https://soulbodyhealingcenter.com/holistic-healing/) food.

I've never heard any of these scientists say anything like this but all they do is bust myths and tell people to eat whatever produce and meat you can, so why not just be straightforward and tell people to just buy conventional food?

Environmental reasons are often secondary (or tertiary). But in fact, organic food is neither significantly safer nor healthier than conventionally produced food.^[3](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/is-organic-agriculture-really-better-for-the-environment/2016/05/14/e9996dce-17be-11e6-924d-838753295f9a_story.html?utm_term=.d9f26f63d8ff) ^[4](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/science-sushi/httpblogsscientificamericancomscience-sushi20110718mythbusting-101-organic-farming-conventional-agriculture/) There is no scientific evidence that organic food contains more nutrients. Organic farming often uses pesticides which are cited as being natural or derived from nature, without paying attention to their toxicity. \"They\\'re [large organic farms] organic by the letter, not organic in spirit... if most organic consumers went to those places, they would feel they were getting ripped off.\" ^[4](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/science-sushi/httpblogsscientificamericancomscience-sushi20110718mythbusting-101-organic-farming-conventional-agriculture/) I believe that organic farming will advance, but that it is currently, at least in some part, detrimental to the environment. Embracing modern technology would benefit sustainable farming, as would letting go of strict (or not so strict) rules. In my opinion, the best option is to combine efficiency and sustainability. What do you think?\\n\\nEdit: I am considering current diets, but with organic food.

It\\'s just that the chemicals are \"naturally occurring.\" They aren\\'t as effective as normal herbicides and insecticides so the increased usage leads to increased runoff into streams and rivers just to consider a corner of the farm \"organic.\" Farmers are losing money because in order to remain competitive they need to convert a patch of their land to organic which will be a less productive use of the soil.\\n\\nAnd the non-GMO labels are a crock of shit. Nearly every food can be considered GMOs because we have genetically bred them to fit our needs. Without GMOs we wouldn\\'t have drought resistant corn and wheat. We wouldn\\'t be able to have plants protect themselves from insects leading to less runoff.\\n\\nedit: The best thing to do environmentally is grow it yourself but not everyone has the means to do that.',\n",

So we’d need to use more than double the land to produce the same amount of food, therefore completely negating the reduced carbon footprint. One of the biggest impacts agriculture has on the environment is destruction of natural ecosystems and wildlife. Non-GMOs have the same problem, increasing carbon usage and land usage to produce the same amount of food. We need to science the hell out of our god production to get as much as we can with as little land as possible. There is no real evidence that suggests non-GMOs or organic foods are healthier for us. Organic farms use just as many pesticides but get away with it because the pesticides are “natural”, but less effective and they therefore need to use more of them. Organic farms are not going to help reverse climate change or repopulate wild life. This doesn’t mean there shouldn’t be regulations on non-organic/non-GMOs for the safety of the environment and the consumer, but I think it’s the lesser of three evils.',\n",

       "  'After playing Farming Simulator for the past couple of years, I felt that I needed a new challenge. Therefore, I decided to go (almost) fully organic, and to start from the bottom of the ladder which meant micro farming.\\n\\nThat means that I gave myself 200 000 $ loan, that’s it, with which I bought myself two pieces of land (108 000 $), including one that was a property where I would live. I built on that one seven gardens at 2000 $ each and three chicken coop.\\n\\nWith that budget, no way I could afford a tractor. So all I used for the first years of the game was the John Deere Gator 4X2… which is a BEAST! And all I allowed myself to do is rent the smallest pieces of equipment to work my field.\\n\\nGoing organic also meant that I wouldn’t use any chemical fertilizer on my fields. Only cover crops. It also meant that any fruits, vegetable, honey or eggs I would produce had to be sold immediately, just like in real life. So I built myself a little selling lodge next to my house.\\n\\nAfter a couple of years, I was able to repay my loan and buy an extra piece of land. On it, I built two pigsties. Yes, pigsties are not exactly organic, but that was the only way I could collect slurry to fertilize my fields. That’s pretty much the only non-organic thing I allowed myself to do. However, when it came to feeding the pigs, everything had to come from my harvests. In fact, I never allowed myself to sell more than 50 000 L of grain each year. If I had more than that, it meant I was relying too much on machinery. \\n\\nMoney started to come in. So, in the following years, I started to add many more greenhouses, foil tunnels, strawberry fields and I even built myself a pretty big érablière (as we say in Québec, maple farms for everyone else), always trying to stay as organic as possible. Unfortunately, with every greenhouse mod in FS22, you have to use chemical fertilizer instead of organic (which would cost more), but you don’t get a cash bonus for growing organic foods, so I guess it evens out. \\n\\nSo, after playing more than 275 hours, I’ve pretty much reached my ending point. Especially that I just built my own farming market, which is not only meant to sell what I’m growing, but also to attract tourists. As you can see in the pictures, I have two small pastures, for pigs and for sheeps, a barn for chickens and a playground, just to attract kids and their parents. There’s also a BBQ place when I invite the best Instagram influencers to help my marketing. We’re also selling plants for three times what they’re worth!\\n\\nSo, was this challenge fun? Sure was! It’s a different way of to think the game, where it’s not about buying bigger and bigger equipment, but rather to do more with every little acre you own.',\n",

The Dutton family can start selling their own meat and emphasize how their cattle is free range and organic. They would have to get certified organic, maybe change a few things if they're not organic, and do their own marketing, but it's probably a lot easier, and a lot more legal than all the crazy things they have been doing to keep their ranch.\\n\\nI'm almost through watching season 5, so maybe they addressed this later, but -- the show depicts the Dutton family like they are fighting for a way of life that is no longer valued by the world -- the premise being that there are so many more higher value businesses that can be built on the land while they are losing money every year. Also, environmentalists don't like them because cattle is bad for global warming. \\n\\nHowever, the way they rotate their cattle to different patches of grass is actually quite good, because growing grass captures carbon, the cows eat it, and they grow again -- this actually captures a lot of carbon, and cows that eat grass produce a lot less methane than factory farmed cows. At the same time, there will be a lot of consumers willing to purchase free range cattle herded by cow boys every day at a premium. They would make more money as a business - they may not be as profitable as a ski resort, but they can get the support of people who care about healthy food, and if they argue their case, they can even get the support of environmentalists, and they would be on a growing, positive trend in today's world\\n\\nIt's hard for me to see them go through so much to keep the ranch as if there's just no other way, and I find it hard to believe that the highly-educated Dutton children, who have to be well aware of the organic free range food trend, have never thought of this possibility.\",\n",

The hardest one is the fact that if one of your cows gets sick with an infection, you're not allowed to treat it with antibiotics, ever.  So the cow has to suffer with a treatable infection, and you just have to hope she eventually gets better on her own.  If not, you can treat her, but then you have to sell her to a non-organic farm.  Sometimes by the time you treat with antibiotics, it's too late though.  And if the cow is near death with antibiotics in her system, you can't even sell her for meat.  You just have to let her die and haul her away somewhere where the smell won't bother people.  Usually if this happens we butcher them and use them for meat though, just for ourselves and our neighbors and friends.  \\n\\nStill, there are good aspects of organic farming as well.  For example, organic farmers get paid about twice as much for their milk as non-organic ones.  But overall, and after lots of research, I think the whole organic food system is overrated.  The practices are all well-documented, and I've worked at different types of farms throughout my life.  If this subject is interesting to anyone, AMA.\",\n",

So, for example, when it comes to soil management, organic farmers rely mainly on crop rotation to minimize nutrient deficiencies in the soil. In other words, they use organic manure in amounts specified by law, as well as nitrogen-fixing bacteria.\\n\\nAs for weed control, they use mulching, hand weeding, and tillage. In many cases, they remove weeds with special equipment designed specifically for organic farming. Organic farmers try to reduce the use of synthetic chemicals as much as possible. Thus, to protect the crop, they mainly resort to measures such as traps and natural enemies (predators) of pests of their crop.\\n\\n### How can I get an organic farming certification?\\n\\nIn each country, the definition of organic farming is described and defined by law, and any commercial use of the term \"[organic](https://digiworldofagriculture.blogspot.com/2022/04/%20What-is-organic-farming-Definition-and-examples-of-organic-farming.html)\" is subject to government control. There are specific actions that every potential organic farmer must take (and avoid) to be certified. Even a slight deviation from the law may lead to the termination of this certificate.\\n\\nIf you are interested in organic farming, you can contact the certification body in your area. If you meet the standards, after a certain period (for example, 3-4 years if you grow trees), you will receive the appropriate permission from the authorities. Those farmers who actually follow the rules and also sell their products as \"organic\" can use a special label on their packaging, which allows them to raise the sale price.',\n",

But, serious questions are being raised about the energy-intensive nature of these systems and their adverse effects on soil productivity and environmental quality1,2. This concern has led to an increasing interest in organic farming systems because they may reduce some of the negative effects of conventional agriculture on the environment3,4. We compare the long-term effects (since 1948) of organic and conventional farming on selected properties of the same soil. The organically-farmed soil had significantly higher organic matter content, thicker topsoil depth, higher polysaccharide content, lower modulus of rupture and less soil erosion than the conventionally-farmed soil. This study indicates that, in the long term, the organic farming system was more effective than the conventional farming system in reducing soil erosion and, therefore, in maintaining soil productivity.\\n\\n[Biodynamic Farming](http://infrc.or.jp/english/KNF_Data_Base_Web/PDF%20KNF%20Conf%20Data/C3-3-071.pdf) is even better for the environment than organic, so keep that in mind while choosing the farms to purchase from!',\n",

He has owned this farm since 1994 but never really had anything to show for it so far despite being very dedicated. He has plenty of passion for farming and the planet (being organic), but he falls short in the business side of things. He will also turn 69 in a few months and I feel the energy he is able to provide is faltering. For instance, it seems to me he sometimes foregoes the right decision out of complacency. For instance, our filtering system (not sure if that is the right term) broke down 9 years ago and he did not bother to get it fixed, meaning he either had to outsource the cleaning of the produce (incurring extra costs) or sell it cheaper. We already decided to get it fixed before the next harvest. Another example is that he has a lot of no longer used machines laying around but never gets around to seling them. I will also help him with that. Besides such interventions, I want to put my scientific thinking ability to work in order to make well-informed decisions. Such as what crops to grow each year, etc. He has a wealth of information, but I suspect he and other farmers do not take advantage of all information that is out there. I am trained as a Biology MSc, with a focus on neuroscience, however. I know how to conduct literature research and understand scientific articles. I have, however, no idea what databases are good to consult. We are located in central France. Any tips would be welcome. Furthermore, if you have any other pieces of advice for me in this endeavour, please let me know!\",\n",

       "  'What is organic farming? Today, the phrase \"organic farming\" is not only a household word but the cause of much debate. Some say it is a particularly correct farming method, while others believe it is only partially correct.\\r\\nLet\\'s look at what organic, natural, or nature-based farming (its synonyms) is and what its principles are.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganic farming has several other synonyms: ecological farming, organic farming. Organic or natural farming focuses on the health of the ecosystem, soil, plants, animals, and humans.\\r\\n\\r\\nA LITTLE HISTORY OF ORGANIC FARMING\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theory of organic farming is not as new as it may seem, and similar advances in chemical pesticides occurred in the 1940s, leading to the decade known as the \"pesticide era.\" These new farming techniques, while beneficial in the short term, also had serious long-term side effects, such as soil sloughing, erosion, and an overall decline in soil fertility, as well as health concerns about the toxic chemicals entering the food supply. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, soil biology scientists began to seek ways to remedy these side effects while still maintaining high yields.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1921 Albert Howard, the founder and pioneer of the organic movement, and his wife Gabrielle Howard, an accomplished botanist, founded the Institute of Plant Industry to improve traditional farming practices in India. Among other things, they brought improved tools and improved husbandry methods through scientific training; and then developed protocols for crop rotation, erosion prevention techniques, and the systematic use of compost and fertilizer by combining aspects of traditional Indian methods. Spurred by these experiences in conventional agriculture, Albert Howard returned to England in the early 1930s, where he began to implement organic farming systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral organic farming books reveal principles and evidence that show that a thinning approach to the soil is less invasive to nature, less time-consuming, and ultimately more productive than intensive farming systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinition: Organic farming is defined as the production of crops, animals, and other products without synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, genetically modified species or antibiotics, and growth-promoting steroids or other chemicals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe research on natural agriculture did not stop there. This is not to say that it has been popular over the years, it has always had proponents and detractors, but research has been ongoing and has proven time and again that careful treatment of the soil leads to truly meaningful results. Thus, what organic farming means today can be expressed in the following terms.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Protecting and maintaining the natural fertility of the soil.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Protection of the ecosystem.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Preservation of the natural fertility of the soil, protection of the ecosystem, and friendly to the environment.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Harvesting with much lower input costs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBASIC METHODS OF ORGANIC FARMING\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBasic Methods Of Organic Farming - What Is Organic Farming\\r\\n\\r\\nBasic Methods Of Organic Farming - What Is Organic Farming\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the above, the principles of organic farming become clear.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Reject deep tillage.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Reject mineral fertilizers.\\r\\n\\r\\n- rejection of pesticides.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Promotion of microorganisms and worms.\\r\\n\\r\\nRejection of deep tillage\\r\\n\\r\\nThis rejection of deep plowing of the soil is based on the understanding that the upper layers of the soil are home to a large number of organisms that not only produce humus but also improve soil structure. Plowing and deep digging destroy their habitat conditions, altering the microbial composition of the topsoil and, with it, the natural ability to maintain soil fertility, increasing the risk of weathering and leaching of elements important to plants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe negative effects of this cultivation technique do not appear immediately, but after a few years, making it necessary to apply mineral fertilizers and other chemicals to keep yields at appropriate levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to conservation agriculture, the soil should not be turned over but should be loosened to a depth of no more than 2-2.7 inches (5-7 cm) - preferably 1 inch (2.5 cm).\\r\\n\\r\\nRejection of mineral fertilizers\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rejection of mineral fertilizers is based on the realization that almost all fertilizers (substances added to the soil to replenish missing nutrients) have a hidden aftereffect. Under their influence, the acidity in the soil is gradually altered, the natural cycle of substances is disturbed, the species composition of soil organisms is changed and the soil structure is disrupted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, certain mineral fertilizers have a negative impact on the environment (air, water) and the plants themselves, thus affecting product quality and human health.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganic farming replaces the use of fertilizers with glycosides, mulches, composts, and other organic products.\\r\\n\\r\\nAvoiding the use of pesticides\\r\\n\\r\\nNo herbicide, pesticide or fungicide is non-toxic. They are all toxic substances (for this reason, there are strict regulations on the use of pesticides) and tend to accumulate in the soil in the form of residues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, for example, it has been calculated that the percentage of yield loss can reach 25% in the subsequent crop rotation due to using some herbicides under the main crop.\\r\\n\\r\\nNature-based agriculture recommends measures to prevent diseases and pests, but if the problem is not prevented, folk remedies or biological agents should be used.\\r\\n\\r\\nEncouraging the growth of microorganisms and worms\\r\\n\\r\\nThe promotion of microorganisms and worms in organic farming is based on the fact that these soil inhabitants are directly involved in soil formation. Thanks to microorganisms and larger inhabitants of the soil (worms, bugs, spiders), mineralization of organic residues, the transformation of vital nutrients, fight against pathogenic microorganisms, pests, improvement of soil structure, and many other things lead to a soil characterized by health.\\r\\n\\r\\nHealthy soil is the basis for healthy plants, able to resist adverse climatic events, diseases, and pests.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo achieve this principle, Natural Agriculture recommends using organic matter, EM preparations, and the avoidance of deep digging to improve soil fertility.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore Related Information About Gardening Beginners\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n#ThumbGarden #Garden #Gardening #Funfacts #Garden #Interesting #Livewell #Mentalhealth #Organics #What #Why\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthor: Ms.Geneva\\r\\nLink: https://www.thumbgarden.com/what-is-organic-farming/\\r\\nSource: ThumbGarden\\r\\nThe copyright belongs to the author.

It is also relatively easy to obtain, the problem is that it is mixed with other compounds, which although they are still non-toxic, much more would have to be added. For example, for my pea crop I used less than a kilo. Just look at the costs of some poison for worms, some poison for ants, cockroaches, fleas, among others, and what's more, all these poisons can kill you, or the poor devil who fumigates, it will also be very expensive . Due to its minerals and the ph it has, it is also effective against fungi, but not so much.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-Copper oxychloride is also very effective, and cheap, technically it does not kill the fungus, but rather prevents the spores from reproducing, so if you apply it to the soil, and to the plants, you will not have any problem. Technically it is not organic, but it is not toxic.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-Deltamethrin: It is technically a synthetic pyrethrin that works against aphids, it is also very effective, and very cheap. It is not technically organic either, but in any case it also comes with natural pyrethrin but it is a little more expensive.\\n\\nAlternatives to pyrethrin (Garlic pudding, tobacco tea, and anti-aphid cloth) These alternatives are either less effective but cheaper, or more effective and much more expensive, but they work if you have a greenhouse or plants at home.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-Plastic: Plastic ends up being cheaper than using fungicides, since it has an average life of about 5 years, some plastics can also be recycled.\\n\\nUsing these elements, I had no problem with fungus or any kind of insect. Do not spend more than 50 usd per hectare, surely in your country it is more expensive, but I do not think it is more expensive than bromide, and than the 999 different agrochemicals for each different bug.\",\n",

This year, the topic was discussed intensively at the Farm & Food Congress in January 2020: \" Regenerative agriculture is a form of land use in which we try.\\n\\nInstead of just fighting or avoiding the symptoms of our prevailing production model, we can try to use technology to change the causes as well,” said Benedikt Bösel at the Farm & Food Congress.\\n\\nBösel is the managing director of the Schlossgut Alt Madlitz farm in Brandenburg. “We try to implement new methods and see how they work and how we can scale them,” Bösel explains. However, there are not many farmers in Germany who think like Bösel. According to current estimates, around 50,000 hectares in Germany are farmed according to the principles of regenerative arable farming - both organic and conventional farms. Organic farmers, on the other hand, farm 1.6 million hectares - that\\'s 10 percent of the total area.\\n\\nThe pioneers and best-known practitioners of [regenerative agriculture](https://digiworldofagriculture.blogspot.com/2022/07/Regenerative-agriculture-the-better-organic-or-nonsense.html) in Germany currently include: Friedrich Wenz from Baden-Württemberg, Dietmar Näser from Saxony and Ingrid Hörner from Hesse. Friedrich Wenz is a Demeter farmer – i.e. an organic farmer. His farm has been working cattle-free and plow-free for decades. Dietmar Näser is a freelance crop cultivation consultant and Ingrid Hörner also runs an agricultural business. She deals with the recultivation of agricultural land after structural changes.',\n",

This technical paper discusses the three groups of living  organisms (bacteria, plants and fish) that make up the aquaponic  ecosystem. It presents management strategies and troubleshooting  practices, as well as related topics, specifically highlighting the  advantages and disadvantages of this method of food production. This  publication discusses the main theoretical concepts of aquaponics,  including the nitrogen cycle, the role of bacteria, and the concept of  balancing an aquaponic unit. It considers water quality, testing and  sourcing for aquaponics, as well as methods and theories of unit design,  including the three main methods of aquaponic systems: media beds,  nutrient film technique, and deep water culture. \\n\\nThe publication includes other key topics: ideal conditions for  common plants grown in aquaponics; chemical and biological controls of  common pests and diseases including a compatible planting guide; common  fish diseases and related symptoms, causes and remedies; tools to  calculate the ammonia produced and biofiltration media required for a  certain amount of fish feed; production of homemade fish food;  guidelines and considerations for to establishing aquaponic units; a  cost-benefit analysis of a small-scale, media bed aquaponic unit; a  comprehensive guide to building small-scale versions of each of the  three aquaponic methods; and a brief summary of this publication  designed as a supplemental handout for outreach, extension and  education. \\n\\nAquaponics is an integrated approach to efficient and  sustainable intensification of agriculture that meets the needs of water  scarcity initiatives. Globally, improved agricultural practices are  needed to alleviate rural poverty and enhance food security. Aquaponics  is residue-free, and avoids the use of chemical fertilizers and  pesticides. Aquaponics is a labour-saving technique, and can be  inclusive of many gender and age categories. In the face of population  growth, climate change and dwindling supplies of water and arable land  worldwide, developing efficient and integrated agriculture techniques  will support economic development.\\n\\n* [Download publication](https://www.fao.org/3/a-i4021e.pdf)',\n",

       "  \"  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThere is no doubt that a radical change is needed in our current agricultural and food system. Our agricultural and food system pollutes the soil, is unhealthy, has grown unbalanced worldwide, brings yields and profits in the chain not to the farmers, but to the banks and multinationals. A radical change can be achieved by switching to 100% organic farming. This production method is not only good for the soil, the environment, climate and biodiversity, animal friendliness, people’s health and the earning capacity of the farmer, but does justice to all those involved. We have to face up to what is going on at the moment and that takes courage. And, finally, we must develop the ability not to enjoy our food less, but to enjoy it better. \\n\\n*Farmers not less, but more.* \\n\\nFarmers should not be bought out. That's the dumbest thing one can do. We have advanced in scaling up, which has been going on for decades and should not have happened for decades. The scale increase has not only made more production possible, but also ensured that our production has become less and less sustainable, as a result of the increase in fertilizers and chemical pesticides. This has all kinds of consequences for the environment, biodiversity and climate: emissions of CO2, Methane, Nitrogen and Phosphorus, pollination problems, residues of chemical pesticides, deforestation. We must therefore move towards a sustainable agricultural and food system. That is not possible on the current large scale. The organic farmer needs more attention for soil and crops and will therefore be able to cultivate less hectares. And that means that more farmers are needed, because in sustainable agriculture the average surface area per farm is lower than in industrial agriculture. Buying out farmers will not ensure that we produce less and therefore also pollute less, but, on the contrary, the increase in scale and pollution will continue even more strongly. \\n\\n*Do not withdraw agricultural land from food production* \\n\\nIf agricultural land is withdrawn from agriculture, an even bigger problem arises, even though in the western world we are currently producing far too much. This seems contradictory, but it isn't. For a healthy diet, with reduced animal protein consumption, the required land use is about 5,000 m2 per capita. See also the Blog: ‘Enough farmland to ensure a healthy diet for all people, improve global biodiversity and limit climate change in 2050’. In the Netherlands for example, the quantity of available agricultural land is only a little more than 1,000 m2 per capita, which is far too little to provide all Dutch people with a healthy diet. Despite this small amount of land, we produce and export far, far too much. We do this with raw materials that are imported from abroad. To a large extent, these raw materials come from far-away poor countries, where they impoverish the soil and nature. So, what is needed is a switch from current agriculture to sustainable agriculture. On our planet as a whole there is enough agricultural land for local and sustainable production of a healthy diet for all people now and also in 2050. The quantity farmland per capita worldwide available in 2010 was almost 7,000 m2 and will be a bit more than 5,000 m2 in 2050. This lower amount, mainly due to the increase of the world population between 2010 and 2050, is still enough to feed the world's population with a healthy diet, sustainably produced**.** However, the availability of agricultural land per capita is very unevenly distributed among the countries of the world. For poor countries there will arise a dramatic shortage: much less than 3,000 m2 per capita in 2050, while the rich countries will have almost 1 ha per capita. \\n\\n*Recruit new farmers who can produce sustainably* \\n\\n*W*e should not buy out farmers, but recruit new farmers. And then it is about farmers who are able to produce in a sustainable way. There is currently a lot of knowledge lacking for this. A shift in the agricultural knowledge and innovation system is therefore needed, which is now fully focused on large-scale agriculture and ever-expanding technology. There is a lot of practical knowledge on a small scale about organic, agro-ecological agriculture and circular agriculture, but not enough to significantly expand these forms of agriculture. The much-needed switch to sustainable agriculture therefore means that we will produce less per farmer/farm, but it will be sustainable.\\n\\n*Halve meat consumption* \\n\\nWe use a lot of raw materials because we eat way too much meat. This is also very unhealth and  leads to all kinds of diseases. This is another cost item that is not included in the prices of the large-scale agricultural products, but ends up in the ever-increasing costs of health care. We can assume that the population will become much healthier on average if we halve our meat consumption. So along with the agricultural reform, we need a reform of our diet. The conclusion is: instead of halving the number of farmers, we should double the number of farmers and halve the meat consumption. \\n\\n*Food package costs can remain constant* \\n\\nThe sustainable products will be more expensive than the products from large-scale polluting agriculture. To a large extent this is because the current agricultural products from the large-scale agricultural industry are far too cheap, since many costs are not passed on in the prices. Cleaning the land that is being over-exploited, polluted and exhausted by chemical fertilizers and pesticides saddles future generations with high costs. With little rain, these lands dry out very quickly because they cannot retain water due to the low organic content. With a lot of rain, flooding and erosion occur. If we were to restore this, which does not happen, there would be an incredible amount of costs involved that are not being charged now. This system of agriculture entails a lot of waste, which can be prevented in a sustainable system. Moreover, the prices of large-scale agricultural products are so low because a lot of subsidies are given from Brussels for this form of agriculture. If the subsidy that now goes to large-scale agriculture benefits the production of sustainable vegetables, the total costs of the food package, with less meat, will not increase and we will also get a healthier population and more employment. \\n\\n*Large-scale agri-food sector won't solve it*\\n\\nThe above proposals are concrete, offer a view of the problems we currently face and indicate a clear path to a sustainable agricultural and food system. We can get started right away. This is in stark contrast to the full-page article, or advertisement, in Brabants Dagblad of 12 October 2021 by AGRI NL. AgriNL calls itself one of the most important players in the Agrifood sector. According to the article with the ambitious title: 'Towards a sustainable perspective of the Netherlands and its agriculture', sustainable solutions to the problems we currently face and perspective require an area-oriented and integrated approach, which requires customization and something extra. That extra would be the willingness to compromise a bit. There would also be a willingness to put the common interest above one's own interest, but there should be sufficient space and resources for farmers to take the necessary steps for the future. It is not stated which steps and which future it concerns. According to the article, the social challenges must be solved in balance, whereby the government must ensure support. What all this should entail remains unmentioned. But, if we do all this - the article says - we can build new houses and new infrastructure, and space will be created for the agricultural sector and for extra nature. There are only generalities in the full-page text, but no concrete action.\\n\\n*Local and sustainable initiatives, facilitated by* 2local*, bring the solution*\\n\\nWe need a completely different approach. Solutions do not come from multinationals and banks, nor even from governments surrounded by heavy lobbyists. We will have to do it ourselves: as farmers and citizens, as producers and consumers, as restaurants and customers, as recreation companies and farm-based tourists/holidaymakers. In short: as parties close to each other, who value local and sustainable. The loyalty platform *2local* facilitates these local and sustainable initiatives, using the wealth of the blockchain. *2local* wants to stimulate the production and consumption of local and sustainable products and services by working with crypto coins (the *2-LoCal*, 2LC), based on blockchain technology, several crypto related products and a cashback system. Paying with 2LC digital coins is direct and easy and the cashback system guarantees accessibility for everyone, even for people who have little to spend. To make these things even more affordable the 2local platform also uses profit from the blockchain and from Green investors. One of the features of *2local* is a digital Marketplace where producers and consumers can meet. The Marketplace offers the possibility to search for connected companies - companies registered on the *2local* website - using various filters. The connected companies get free advertising and therefore more potential customers. This implies a shift towards smaller, localized production and distribution of goods and services. It means more personal cohesion between people, less polluting transport around the world and easier quality controls (via short chains instead of long global chains that are not transparent). It is important that everyone in the world can benefit from the *2local* initiative. The introduction of a cashback for local and sustainable products also gives people with less money access to sustainable products. This stimulates everyone's involvement in the local economy and will increase sustainability and prosperity in the world.\\n\\nHarry Donkers \\n\\n26 October 2021\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2o0ygg7vprv71.jpg?width=2970&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=472f103600a205d337b07934097cd2bc14b51164\",\n",

They've gotten the family into composting, growing our own chillies, not using up so much energy on A/C during the summers, and avoiding single-use plastics as much as possible. \\n\\nThey've also began insisting that we buy only organic fruits and vegetables and they've began asking to go more frequently to one of those hipster detox juice places. I'm okay with going to the detox place once every month or every couple of months as a treat (it's better than other splurges at least), but I am not budging on the organic vegetables issue. I'm taking the stance of the scientific community, which is that there is no health benefits of organic foods over their conventionally farmed counterparts. I don't see the need to spend extra money for nothing, and it worries me that the costs will add up as produce is something we purchase every week. I also told them I'm not willing to buy those detox bottled juices at the supermarket because they're ridiculously expensive for the amount that you get. And again, no proven health benefits. \\n\\nWhat I have suggested as an alternative is that we go more frequently to weekend farmers' markets around our area so that when they buy organic foods they can at least pay for the benefit of supporting local farmers. My wife has taken our daughters' side though. She has no stance on the GMO/organic debate as she hasn't researched the issue, but said our daughters' peace of mind is worth the marginal costs. We are a financially stable family so we're not hurting for money, but I just can't bring myself to support my daughters on this issue. \\n\\nAm I in the wrong here?\",\n",

Organic produce is generally more expensive than conventional produce.\\n\\nThe majority of the public believes that organic farming does not use pesticides, however this is not true. Organic farming does not use *synthetic* pesticides (with a few exceptions) but instead uses naturally derived pesticides. Naturally derived pesticides are not by definition any better for your health than synthetic, because whether something is natural has no bearing on whether it is healthful or good. (Don't believe me? Try eating a random mushroom in the forest.) To assume that natural is better is the [appeal to nature fallacy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature) A great example: copper sulfate and rotenone/pyrethrin mixture are pesticides approved for organic farming that are more toxic than many synthetic pesticides.\\n\\nStudies that find fewer pesticide residues on organic produce are essentially rigged - they are only testing for the synthetic pesticides, giving a free pass to the naturally derived ones.\\n\\nThe current scientific consensus (i.e. the consensus of scientific observation and experiment) shows no health benefit to eating organic produce. Sure, you can probably find a single study that says otherwise (you can find a single study to support almost any opinion) however it is the consensus of large amounts of high quality scientific evidence that is important.\\n\\nAnother reason people buy organic is to avoid GMO's, even though the leading [scientific organizations](http://www.siquierotransgenicos.cl/2015/06/13/more-than-240-organizations-and-scientific-institutions-support-the-safety-of-gm-crops/) in the world have concluded, based on over 3,000 scientific studies, that GMO's are completely safe for humans to eat.\\n\\nHere is some more material if you want to read more. Some of these are blog posts because those are more accessible for a layperson, but the blogs do reference scientific studies if you want to read those.\\n\\n[Organic farming effects on the environment](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/organic-farming-is-bad-for-the-environment/)\\n\\n[Example of a meta analysis where the studies tested for synthetic pesticides and not natural ones](http://www.crediblehulk.org/index.php/category/genetic-engineering-and-agricultural-science/organic-food/)\\n\\n[Meta-analysis: organic not more nutritious than conventional](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22944875)\\n\\n[Systematic review: Evidence is lacking for purported organic health benefits](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20463045)\\n\\nTLDR: Buy whatever produce is cheaper, whether organic or not.\\n\\nEDIT: I'm all for people choosing organic for other reasons, like supporting a local farmer. I just wanted to emphasize that you don't need to spend extra for the purported health benefits.\",\n",

Sometimes pesticides which get banned as being too dangerous in one region  continue to be used in other parts of the world. \\n\\nI'm also curious about the status of organic produce here. At street markets no distinctions are made between produce sold, so I'm guessing  none of it is organic. And I have noticed most suprrmarkets  I go into only offer conventional produce. I mainly see organic produce offered by small specialty  stores that specifically call themselves organic where the prices are so incredibly high compared to other stores that I imagine few can afford it, which makes me think only the rich can eat organic here. The other night I stopped into one of these stores and saw a pineapple for 250 NTD. \\n\\nI purchased a head of conventional iceberg lettuce the other day for 70 NTD. Back home I'd pay the equivalent of 30 NTD for the same head grown organically. I can't imagine how much it would have cost for organic - and lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow!\\n\\nI also noticed that even Costco has very few organic produce  options both fresh and frozen. So despite being an American company that offers a very wide range  of  organic options in their American stores, for some reason Costco has decided to offer a severely  reduced range of  organic produce options  in their taipei stores.\\n\\nIs there simply no demand for organic food here or are there other elements at play?\",\n",

       "  'It’s easy to pick up packaged foods like pasta, rice and beans for a few pennies, but produce – especially in certain areas that don’t have great growing seasons - can be costly at times.  If you want to eat organic (not always the most frugal choice, but important to some), it’s even more expensive.  Here’s an idea for you to save on both.  All you need are a few friends and to be within driving distance of a larger city.  \\n\\nLarger cities have food distribution centers.  This is the central area where produce comes in and where your local grocery stores go and pick it up from.  However, most people don’t know that they’ll sell to the public as well, for a fraction of what you pay in the stores (because you don’t have the markup).  The only catch is that they sell their produce in cases (24 heads of lettuce, 100 lbs of potatoes, etc).\\n\\nGather a group of friends (5 or 6 is ideal) and each month, or week, or however often you want, each of you pitch in a set amount, say $50.  Then go down to the distribution center (well, you might want to call first and place your order, but it’s not always necessary), pick up your produce cases, and divide it amongst your friends.  \\n\\nEven better, while you’re there, ask for “seconds” – the cases of produce that are starting to go bad, or are irregularly shaped, or so on.  These cases can usually be purchased for a dollar or two and is like paying pennies.  \\n\\nI’ve been doing this for years, and I’ve saved a considerable amount of money on produce.  \\n\\nEDIT:  I haven\\'t found any central companies for the US, but if you google \"produce distribution [your city], there should be your first few options on top.  I would call the main number, double check that they sell to the public, and get their hours.  (Some are only open morning hours).  \\n\\nIf you still can\\'t find any distributors by you, you could try calling a local grocery store and asking where they pick up their produce from.  \\n',\n",

The USDA listened to the challenges of reliance on imported organic feed and the time it takes to become certified organic. The recent turmoil and conflicts have shined an ever greater spotlight. Secretary Tom Vilsack announced a two-pronged approach to supporting and developing the domestic organic market to continue this rapid growth.\\n\\nFirst, the new Organic Market Development Grant (OMDG) Program will issue $75 million in competitive grants. These grants can be used for various supply chain or production improvements, from processing to capacity to developing new consumer-facing products.\\n\\nSecond, the USDA has raised the cost share amount under the Organic Certification Cost Share Program or OCCSP. This program helps organic producers cover organic certification costs.\\n\\n*“As USDA works to help make our nation’s food system more resilient and create more options for producers and consumers, we recognize the important role the organic industry can play in expanding opportunities for value-added agriculture, strengthening supply chains, and generating revenue for farmers,” Vilsack said. “For many farmers, the transition period before attaining organic certification can be cost-prohibitive, so USDA is also helping mitigate the risk involved for farmers who want to be able to grow and market organic crops.”*',\n",

       "  \"As we become more aware of the importance of healthy eating, the demand for organic produce has skyrocketed in recent years. Organic farming is a method that avoids synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and instead focuses on natural methods of pest control and soil improvement. But what about buying locally grown food? How does that fit into the equation?\\n\\nSupporting local farmers by buying their produce is an important part of sustainable living. It not only helps to preserve the environment, but also supports the local economy and provides fresher and more nutritious food options. In this blog post, we will dive into the importance of supporting local farmers and buying organic produce.\\n\\nEnvironmental Benefits\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of buying locally grown produce is reducing the carbon footprint. When food is grown locally, it doesn't have to travel as far to reach your plate, reducing the amount of fuel used for transportation. This means fewer emissions released into the air, which contributes to cleaner air and a healthier environment.\\n\\nAdditionally, organic farming practices support healthy soil and water. Without the use of harmful chemicals and synthetic fertilizers, organic farmers use natural methods such as crop rotation and composting to improve soil health. This, in turn, helps to prevent soil erosion and water pollution.\\n\\nSocial Benefits\\n\\nBuying locally grown food also supports the local economy. When you buy from local farmers, you are investing in the community and helping to create jobs. Small-scale farmers are also more likely to reinvest their earnings back into the local economy, as opposed to large corporations that often move their profits to other regions.\\n\\nMoreover, buying from local farmers creates a sense of community and promotes social interaction. When you visit local farmers' markets or participate in community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs, you get to meet the farmers and learn about their farming practices. This creates a sense of connection between the farmers and the community, which is often lost when buying from large chain grocery stores.\\n\\nNutritional Benefits\\n\\nOrganic produce is known to be richer in nutrients than conventionally grown produce. A study published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine found that organic crops have higher concentrations of antioxidants and lower levels of pesticide residues compared to conventionally grown crops.\\n\\nAdditionally, buying locally grown produce means that you are buying produce that is fresher and has a higher nutrient content. Local farmers are able to harvest their crops when they are ripe and deliver them quickly to consumers, ensuring that the produce is at its peak freshness and nutritional value.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nSupporting local farmers and buying organic produce is a win-win situation. It not only supports the environment, but also the local economy and our health. By reducing the carbon footprint, promoting community interaction, and providing fresher and more nutritious food options, we can all play a part in creating a sustainable future.\",\n",

I'd like to know your opinion and I'll also try to give some discussion points, from the perspective of an European agronomy student. \\n\\n* Fertilizers: with synthetic fertilizers being forbidden in organic ag, they are frequently replaced by animal products (e.g. manure). The production of synthetic fertilizers is energy intensive, and we get P and K from non-renewable sources. Meanwhile manure and sludges are expensive to transport (since they are mostly water) and often contain nutrients in unpractical relative quantities (this causes P eutrophication in areas with intensive animal farming).\\n* Herbicides: in conventional agriculture their use allows in many cases to minimize soil lavoration, but may lead to weeds developing resistances. Organic ag has to rely on mechanical weeding, increasing fuel consumption; however the weed problem strongly encourages effective crop rotation in organic. \\n* Ethics: organic ag is founded on the principles of health, ecology, fairness and care. One could argue that with organic produce being more profitable many farmers are brainlessly following a set of rules, though.\\n* Land use: organic farming is generally less productive, meaning it needs more soil to produce the same amount of produce. However the land used has higher biodiversity and soil organic matter.\\n\\nOf course many other points can be made, these are just from the top of my head. I can elaborate on them if you want me to. \\n\\nI am particularly interested in wether you consider vegan or not produce farmed on land fertilized by animal products. \\n\\nSorry for the lame poll; I couldn't add any more options.  \\n\\n\\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/nqomr8)\",\n",

       "  'TL;DR - organic vegetables are better for the planet and for agriculture than conventional vegetables grown in monocultures.\\n\\nThis topic comes up with some regularity, but it has been a while since I have seen it. It is regularly advised for people to buy conventional rather than organic produce because it is basically the same but cheaper. If all you are concerned about is the nutritional content of the food, I suppose this is true to an extent and this post is not intended for you, but I want to make a case for organic produce even if it can be spendy.\\n\\nIn general, buying organic is a better, more responsible purchasing decision, and I have recently decided to begin exclusively purchasing organic when it is available. Regardless of whether or not pesticides and herbicides effect human health, they wreak havoc on environmental health. Organic certified produce does not have the most harmful of chemicals applied to it as convential crops do. This is the least important reason, especially since synthetics are still allowed and widely used, howerver....\\n\\nOrganic crops, due to being forbidden certain substances, require crop rotation, natural fertilizers, and increased soil health. I won\\'t go too deep in this, but these things (especially crop rotation and natural fertilizing) are critical for the health of agricultural production and have to be supported over the monocultures of traditional farmers in order to aid in fixing our broken planet. Oil companies don\\'t want this to happen because they make the products that are used in the synthetics, and so there is a lot of disinformation out there regarding health and crop yields. Countless examples of these biases and their rhetoric can be seen everywhere - like the fact that the alternative to \"Organic\" produce is \"Conventional,\" as though conventional is the way it\\'s always been done rather than a new phenomenon from the last 75 years.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, the best answer is grow your own food, and if that isn\\'t an option, buy local organic, then grocery store organic, then standard produce. I hope to one day have my own homestead, but until then I have found my locally grown produce within biking distance and I\\'m sticking with it and encouraging others to do the same.',\n",

As someone who grew up on a farm that produced CERTIFIED organic vegetables and meat I can tell you right now that just because you\\'re corn was grown in cow shit, without pesticides, by four hippies that live on a commune and don\\'t know good horticulture processes from their arsehole does not give stall holders and \"boutique produce sellers\" the right to sell you sub par vegetables and produce  because \"oh yeah man they\\'re organic so sometimes they don\\'t look like the store bought stuff, it\\'s meant to be like that from nature\".\\n\\nThis is absolute BS! For starters if someone is claiming that their product is organic they actually legally have to back it up by showing you the certification. From EVERY product they\\'re claiming is organic. They can\\'t just slap \"Crystal\\'s organic vegetables\" on a sign out the front of their stall and have only one product in their stall with certification and the rest of it just be shit that they scavenged from the Woolies green waste bin on the way to the markets that day. A lot of the cost that goes into a farmer getting certifications for their organic produce is inspections to make sure that not only is the product up to organic standards. But also that the product meets certain output criteria and that food standards are upheld as well. \\n\\nThis pisses me off so much because not only having grown up on a farm that produced organic produce but that people are getting scammed out of the toxic markup on organic food that\\'s likely either NOT organic or hasn\\'t been held to the same standard as actual certified organic food.\\n\\nTL:DR if you buy \"organic\" corn at the market at twice the price of non-organic and its only got two thirds of the kernals ripened on it. You\\'re not buying organic corn, you\\'re buying somebody\\'s faliure (and likely fraud) at twice the price.\\n\\nEdit: Grammar',\n",

But there's been tons of times when I checked my receipt at home and found to have been overcharged on certain items because the store didn't price correctly an item on clearance/sale, or charged more than what it said on the shelf. Sure, most stores have policies that you can get the item for free if that happens but people don't notice or notice too late and don't bother going to customer service.
