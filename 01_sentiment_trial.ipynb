Or if it's someone on social media I can scroll through their profile for less than 5 minutes and see them talking about the new Burger King chicken sandwich or whatever.\\nSure, they may be unaware that there's no ethical way to consume animal products so buying those doesn't actually make it okay. I totally get that. I was before too. But the fact is they do buy factory farmed products (either mostly or EXCLUSIVELY!) and are lying about it. Why?

The one thing John has a problem with is me refusing to spend my money on meat. Ever since I started making my own money, I swore to myself that I would never spend a cent of it on meat. On our dates, we usually spilt the bill and sometimes he pays for it all. I told him if he orders something meat-free, I’d happily pay for both of us but he never does. When he pays for my food, it’s when I’ve spend money on the activity. Normally concerts and festivals. That’s me paying €120+ on tickets and him spending maybe €50 on food\\nHis birthday was a few days ago and we went out for dinner at his favourite fancy restaurant. He got the most expensive steak they had along with a side salad and a bottle of wine. When we finished our food, I asked the waiter to spilt the bill and John looked at me shocked. He asked if I was joking and I said no. Then he told me he thought I was going to pay since it was his birthday and he didn’t budget for the meal. I asked him why he thought I’d pay since I’ve been very clear about my rule but he couldn’t give me a reason other than it being his birthday.\\nRead more', 'Reported to support who did nothing but refund the order which should be a no brainer considering most of the meal was spilt into the bag after he threw it against my door.

It is also relatively easy to obtain, the problem is that it is mixed with other compounds, which although they are still non-toxic, much more would have to be added. For example, for my pea crop I used less than a kilo. Just look at the costs of some poison for worms, some poison for ants, cockroaches, fleas, among others, and what's more, all these poisons can kill you, or the poor devil who fumigates, it will also be very expensive . Due to its minerals and the ph it has, it is also effective against fungi, but not so much.\\n-Copper oxychloride is also very effective, and cheap, technically it does not kill the fungus, but rather prevents the spores from reproducing, so if you apply it to the soil, and to the plants, you will not have any problem. Technically it is not organic, but it is not toxic.\\n-Deltamethrin: It is technically a synthetic pyrethrin that works against aphids, it is also very effective, and very cheap.

Sustainable farming practices aim to maintain soil fertility and biodiversity, conserve water, reduce pollution, and protect natural ecosystems. This method of farming is essential for ensuring food security and preserving the environment for future generations.\\nOne of the most significant benefits of sustainable farming is that it reduces the negative impact of agriculture on the environment. Conventional farming methods can be detrimental to soil health, causing erosion and reducing the ability of soil to retain water. Sustainable farming techniques, such as crop rotation and cover cropping, help to maintain soil fertility and reduce erosion. This, in turn, helps to conserve water and reduce pollution from soil runoff.\\nSustainable farming practices also promote biodiversity by encouraging the use of natural pest control methods and reducing the use of harmful pesticides and herbicides. These practices can help to prevent the loss of important pollinators like bees and butterflies, which are essential for the health of ecosystems and the production of many crops.\\nAnother benefit of sustainable farming is that it promotes social responsibility. Sustainable farming practices prioritize fair labor practices, animal welfare, and the health and safety of farm workers. This ensures that the food produced is not only healthy for consumers but also ethically produced.\\nOne example of sustainable farming is organic farming. Organic farming eliminates the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, which can harm soil health and the environment. Instead, it relies on natural methods of pest control and fertilization, such as crop rotation, cover cropping, and composting. Organic farming also promotes biodiversity by using a variety of crops and encouraging the use of natural habitats for pollinators and other beneficial organisms.\\nRead more', 'Discover the latest advancements in water treatment technologies that are revolutionizing agriculture. Explore precision irrigation systems, advanced filtration methods, renewable energy integration, and smart water management systems for sustainable farming practices. Learn how these innovations optimize water usage, conserve resources, and promote a greener and more resilient future for agriculture.', 'Organic farming was created in opposition to conventional agriculture and the increasing use of science to help grow our food. Organic proponents thought that going back to nature would lead to more sustainable farming.\\nIn some ways, they are right. Cover cropping, reducing reliance on monocultures, good soil management, crop rotation, etc are all very good practices that help make organic farming more sustainable.\\nHowever, organic farming, specifically referring to certified organic farming, will ultimately fail because it is prevented from using advanced breeding techniques like genetic engineering (GMOs), as well as advanced synthetic inputs.\\nIn the future, if opposition to agri biotech does not increase to even higher levels, I can easily imagine conventional farmers using a variety of genetically engineered plants that will be more nutritious and more environmentally sustainable.\\nOrganic yields will likely increase over the next few decades as farmers improve practices and use non-biotech technology, however, at a certain point, the advancements of GM crops will make conventional agriculture much more efficient than organic farming.\\nSo, at a certain point, if we are not already passed this point, the \"organic\" label will not represent sustainable farming. However, unless a new labelling scheme is implemented, consumers will still buy organic foods thinking it is better for their health or the environment.\\nRead more', \"Please reach out to Joel Salatin of Polyface Farms. He has been a huge inspiration to homesteads and small farms in the United States. We must popularize pragmatic small-scale farming systems. You so often point out how individuals must find opportunity in the abdication of responsibility and point to begin by aiming up and do your best caring for your family and community. Feeding our communities is a practical concern I think is already highly relevant to many of us. I believe Joel Salatin already holds a number of practical answers. He was interviewed by Joe Rogan, but something as pressing as food shortages can't find a large or popular enough platform. Joel empowers and inspires small and new entrepreneurs to build sustainable and profitable farming systems with minimal resources.\", 'TLDR : Cows have over 60% efficiency. Chickens have below 20% efficiency. (when converting hay into proteins in A17)\\nI tried to create an efficient farm, in order to provide lavish meals and great quality of life to my people.\\nFirst of all : a lot of numbers in the wiki about animals are not reliable for theorycrafting (hunger rate, laying/milking intervals etc). The pause during the night increases many intervals, especially for chickens. They should be great on paper, but they are half as efficient in a real colony.\\nMy experiment : I gave a 1 year supply of hay to Chickens and Cows and I measured the amount of proteins they produced. The result was astonishing : Cows produced 3 times as much nutrition as Chickens. The experiment was invitro, as i started a sandbox new game on peaceful with all the events disabled, godmoded the animals, the hay, the impressive goldrooms and the fridge (25 blocks away from animals). Then the 3 pawns, maxed level, took care of all the work. I set the gamespeed to 4 and watched youtube with quick alt-tabs to check when the hay would be depleted.\\nNumbers for Chickens : 1320 Nutrition of Hay given to 54 Hens and 1 Rooster. The foodstock was depleted after 0.625 year. The hens laid 252 Nutrition worth of eggs. ProteinToHayRatio = 19.1% so less than 20% efficiency at producing proteins. Also, the labor for Hauling and Cleaning was 228h (no handling for hens) on this experiment, while each pawns slept 264h. This is half the work done by a dedicated pawn, assuming working twice as much as sleeping.\\nRead more', 'The journey from seed to table can be a long one, but with the right hands and a little bit of know-how, it doesn’t have to be.
