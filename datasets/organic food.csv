Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns."", 'I think it\'s a scam, and I don\'t participate unless I\'m at a farmer\'s market or something.\nPeople sincerely believe that organic food is better for the environment, and in some ways it is. However, organic produce is oftentimes shipped much further to market than non-organic food, so the carbon footprint gets a lot larger for it.\nPeople think organic food is somehow healthier, but they are still sprayed with highly-toxic pesticides while growing. I don\'t care if your pesticide is carbon-based, I care if it\'s still on the tomato when I eat it.\nReally, though, it depends on what I\'m getting. If I\'m purchasing some rosemary for a dish, I\'m not too bothered. And there\'s no way in heck I am dishing out the cash for ""organic"" chicken stock (seriously?). But like, if I\'m making a dish starring a particular ingredient (again, say, tomatoes), I\'m likely to purchase heirlooms, which will most likely be organic.\nI\'ll go a bit further. Modern advances in food science has allowed humanity to use arable land to produce far more crops at far greater yields than ever before. There have been plenty of mistakes along the way--runoff, pesticides that aren\'t good, etc. But things like GMO crops (at least as of now--we will see if we all start growing third eyes) and modern pesticides and fertilizers have turned non-productive land into farmland, allowing for less food insecurity, especially amongst developing nations.\nOkay, a bit more of a tangent. Nothing that we eat is truly ""natural,"" as far as I know. I mean, maybe if you grab a berry off a bush in the forest or a mushroom or something, but everything is being selectively bred for maximum yield or flavor or whatever. The mustard green (I believe?) was bred into broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, etc. Wagyu beef is obviously the result of ranchers selecting beef for marbling. Due to the trans-fat scare back in the 80s, pigs were selected for leaner meat, meaning pork got screwed over.\nBut, getting back to the main topic, I have never noticed a difference in taste between organic or non-organic food, outside of when I can\'t get the product in a non-organic form.', 'The food I buy is fresh, and as raw as possible. I don\'t generally buy anything that comes in a wrapper. I think it\'s healthier and cheaper.\nI don\'t go after ""organic"" labels. Seems those mostly show up on processed shit anyway. Energy bars and that sort of thing. An apple is an apple, near as I can tell.\nAs for what ""organic"" even means, there\'s no standard. If the label appears on your food, I assume you can go to their website and the company will be happy to tell you what THEY mean by organic.\nPeople with less time to cook should look at that information. You should care what you\'re eating. Avoid chemicals, etc. ""Organic"" labels may be a shortcut to that, when your life doesn\'t allow you to mill your own flour or juice your own oranges or whatever. I don\'t mean anything judgmental, just, I have time to do those things, so like, I don\'t need to shop for organic pasta. I\'m making stuff from close to scratch.', 'As for what ""organic"" even means, there\'s no standard.\nWhat do you think about the USDA Organic Seal? Do you think there are standards for food with that seal on them?', 'i never buy them. havent seen a great case for what benefits there are that justify the increased cost', 'Are they superior to conventional foods in any way?\nProbably some minor benefit to consuming fewer of a certain type of exogenous pesticide\nAre they worth the extra cost?\nMaybe....I tend to try to buy local from smaller growers/farmers more than organic tbh. I tend to have the feeling that its a regulatory capture type scam in some way', 'Well it‚Äôs food. I like food..so there‚Äôs that. I mean if you can get it why not? Not sure what the big deal is about food. Organic food is just real food haha', ""I think that capitalism makes them a luxury due to the additional cost. Because of this, attempting to enforce their production is just an elitist virtue signal that harms the poor to make rich people feel good. Personal choice has no detrimental effects. Feed everyone first... then start making food more expensive.\nAs far as genetic modification goes... Corn looked like a damn tiny pine cone before humans started selectively breeding it. Deciding where we should stop meddling with an organism's development is just an appeal to a false sense of normalcy.\nI personally will buy them if they look better. The label means nothing to me. Imma gon smell every tomato. Though nowadays everything just looks less fresh and delicious... I'm guessing due to lower customer spending. Can't have fresh merchandise all the time if it isn't flying off the shelf. I hear that grocery stores can store apples for a lot longer than you would guess."", ""They're a luxury most people can't afford with little evidence that they're any healthier than the alternative."", 'I had some organic carrot juice once. It tasted a bit like dirt.', ""They are superior to non-organic foods since they have less chemicals, and the novelty of buying them adds to the experience, especially when you visit a health-minded store to purchase them. Less so buying them from the Organic bin at Walmart.\nPork in particular is loaded with chemicals and hormones that are definitely better without it. A few people I know have to limit their pork consumption because they are very sensitive to it.However, organic pork (and all organic meat) is quite unaffordable unless I get it at a restaurant beyond-good-by-date surplus store for a massive discount.\nI don't have issues with the non-organic food, but it's a novelty I can't afford in this economy right now, so I buy whatever is the cheapest be it organic or not. Frozen, fresh or canned. By the way, Dollar General generic brand of all places has great canned veggies at a good price with minimal ingredients, and just great canned food in general.\nSpecifically, I buy HOT organic peppers like Ghost Pepper or Carolina Reaper because I can only buy them in-store as organic.

Really destroyed agrarian economies all over Africa and south America, and fueled consolidation of land ownership.\nIt\'s not all bad and I\'m by no means anti gmo, but heirloom genetics are also valuable. And the amount of money that has gone into academia, campaign coffers and agriculture, from the petrol chemical and patent troll industries, should not be understated.

7,Question about organic foods,"I recently attended a lecture where about organic and whole meal foods, where I was told that normal crops are modified to not grow as tall to reduce wasted energy. This leads to shorter roots and less nutrient intake. This makes sense, but I was wondering: if the roots and plant are both smaller, would the concentration of nutrients be the same?
Thanks for any info. I am considering going organic but unsure whether it‚Äôs just a fad or not. Price isn‚Äôt an issue thankfully, I just want what is healthiest.",2023-02-07T09:06:55.471Z,Low_Entertainment_96,"['', 'Organic produce is not necessarily more nutrient dense, and it is not chemical free.

Thank you. This fear of ‚ÄúGMOs‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-organic‚Äù food is usually due to misinformation and marketing tactics. Now that we‚Äôre not afraid of nutritional deficiencies, here‚Äôs something important: you should always wash your produce when you purchase it no matter how much you spent, how much you trust the source, or what claims the labels have. It‚Äôs that simple.', 'GMO crops are heavily sprayed with toxic pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides. This in turn kills the microbiology in the soil which is what is responsible for feeding plants and delivering the nutrients to the roots of the plant. If there is a lack of microbiology there will be a lack of nutrients in the plant or vegetable.\nOrganic growers and farmers tend to build up soil microbiology instead of kill it like GMO mono cropping does. This will lead to more nutrient dense food. So yes if you can find quality organic food from a farmer you trust it is 100% worth it.', 'Organic growers and farmers are also very often growing conventional produce too', 'The organic I mean isn‚Äôt direct from farmers but from supermarkets, is this still fine?', 'There are very small increases in nutritional density in ""organic"" produce. This is not sufficient to justify the price as you can just buy more of the cheaper variety to offset this and still spend less. ""Organic"" also doesn\'t really mean anything, the requirements for its use mean you are paying a premium for no reason much of the time.\nSee similar things with grass finished beef vs grain finished beef, people like to invent woowoo claims to justify their choice to spend more money on something.\nThe aversion to GM crops in the ""organic"" food movement is also a problem. Lets totally ignore the thing that can reduce herbicide & insecticide usage because it sounds bad. The risk of these is almost entirely ecological not human health directly too.\nI like pasture raised eggs because they taste better. Any nutritional benefits from that choice are marginal, at best, and I can\'t discount that cognitive bias plays a role in how I taste that (as well as sight because the yolks are orange rather than yellow). The cognitive effect of cost should absolutely not be discounted because it has a huge impact; in blind taste tests McDonald\'s coffee wins in fast food comparisons but if you ask people what their favourite chain is for coffee you will get Starbucks as the answer.\nPeople think more expensive food tastes better simply because its more expensive.

It\'s just not worth the stress and head space of researching every little thing for me, and I feel like we make efforts often that basically make up for not-so-clean splurges.', ""But surely there are foods that are objectively 'better' or confer more benefits than others. Perhaps fruit which is peeled is less 'worth it' because the pesticides don't make contact with the flesh (as opposed to apples which do).\nIf I were to go organic, I'd have to travel around everywhere to get all the stuff, so I'm trying to figure out the 'must eats'."", 'Choosing organic grains and legumes can reduce exposure to pesticides and may offer higher nutritional value compared to conventionally grown options.', 'Here ya go.\nhttps://www.ewg.org/foodnews/dirty-dozen.php', 'Start with the dirty dozen\nhttps://www.ewg.org/foodnews/dirty-dozen.php', 'Great thinking mate thank you', 'I read a book called ‚Äúdeep nutrition‚Äù she said organic grass fed meat > organic vegetables.

It tastes better too IMO.', 'There are a few different factors to consider when deciding which organic foods are ""worth it.""\nOne factor is the potential health benefits of organic foods. Organic foods are grown without the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. These chemicals can be harmful to human health, and they can also pollute the environment.\nAnother factor to consider is the cost of organic foods. Organic foods can be more expensive than conventionally grown foods. However, the price difference is narrowing, and there are now many affordable organic options available.\nFinally, you may also want to consider your personal values when deciding which organic foods to buy. If you are concerned about the environment or animal welfare, then you may want to choose organic foods that are grown and produced in a sustainable and humane way.\nHere are a few of the organic foods that I believe are ""worth it"":\nFruits and vegetables: Fruits and vegetables are the most commonly sprayed crops with pesticides. Eating organic fruits and vegetables can help to reduce your exposure to these harmful chemicals.\nMeat and dairy: Conventional meat and dairy products may contain antibiotics, hormones, and other chemicals. Organic meat and dairy products are raised without these chemicals, and they may be healthier for you.\nEggs: Conventional eggs may come from chickens that are raised in crowded, unsanitary conditions. Organic eggs come from chickens that are raised in more humane conditions.\nBeans and lentils: Beans and lentils are a good source of protein and fiber. They are also a good source of iron and other nutrients. Organic beans and lentils are grown without the use of pesticides, which can help to reduce your exposure to these harmful chemicals.\nIf you are looking for more information on organic foods, I would recommend checking out notoxapp.com. It\'s a great resource for learning about the different toxins in our environment and how to reduce your exposure to them.\nHere are some additional tips to help you make informed decisions about which organic foods to buy:\nLook for the USDA organic seal when you are shopping for organic foods. This seal ensures that the food has been grown and produced according to USDA organic standards.\nRead the labels carefully. Some foods may be labeled as ""natural"" or ""all-natural."" However, these labels do not mean that the food is organic.\nAsk your grocer about their organic food selection. Many grocers now have a wide variety of organic foods available.\nI hope this helps!', 'The answer you\'re requesting is the ""Clean Fifteen"". Otherwise, the best answer other than all out would rank all the harmful chemicals that inundate the soil, water air, production process, and food supply and subsequently list each and every food contaminated by each and every poison to offer a clear chart that places everything along a full spectrum of certain death to deadly to influences disease to health complications to allergens indigestion, and then on into nutritional content and medicinal, regenerative, and nootropic content. BTW, I would love to see such a complete chart and list set realize.\nA: All. In my young adult years when I was dropped from my parents excellent healthcare plan, I realized my health is entirely my responsibility, so I have since researched nutrition and production processes to motivate an all-out pursuit of the best I can make happen.\nI would even suggest the tightest budget should still shop hard in consideration of micro- then macro-nutrition to make the most of the local market options, even if that means prioritizing Market Match programs which double up to $60 of produce purchases at farmers markets per month for those on welfare. I would rather live close to farmers markets that offer those perks just to get by than out in an isolated and weather-restricted area restricted to the options at a bait and tackle shop. But still, even mostly farmed areas should still promote strong nutritional community to share the organics being grown in trade for friendship, helpfulness, and whatever support, event if it\'s just a local farmers market just for the local farmers to trade produce. Keep in mind, proper fasting can be a very health-promotive strategy that also yields fat loss, and an acceptable BMI can range pretty low to a very trim end of the spectrum (though, I recommend hovering around mid-BMI). Fitness activities should also be utilized to build macronutrients into the body and to expel excess fat storage. Going this route can largely bypass the concepts of calories.']",https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/13eb0i1/which_organic_foods_are_worth_it/

we are young family from mediterranean country looking to relocate for indefinite time to Iceland to find better employment and to explore even more your beautiful country. We visited as a young pair in 2014 and now we want to move there with our toddler.
I read tons of available info already, but one thing that not many people discuss is quality of food and availability year round. High quality and organic food is really important to us, plus we don't eat meat, we are used to getting all the local and organic foods in our country, and things like healthy foods from for example Germany is easy to get by and not too expensive. I mean I can buy organic spelt flour for like 3 euros per kilo, and we also love oat milk, snacks, organic free range local eggs etc. There is also abundance of fruit and veggies. Now I know Iceland imports tons of food and that many shops like Bonus probably sell imported groceries that are regular and full of pesticides... I was wondering, if we get to live outside of capital, probably smaller town in North or East, are there things like organic farmers market or an option to visit local farmers and buy good potatoes,veggies, eggs and grains? How expensive is it? I know you have an excellent fish, but have no idea how much it costs. And can you please tell me how much money do you spend per person on groceries if you try to buy local as much as possible and organic-healthy?

In September I travel to Bulgaria to do a 10-month Erasmus.
I will live in Stara Zagora, a city 2 hours from Plovdiv.

Is the consumption of organic and/or vegan/vegetarian products common there?

70,I can't afford all organic foods. What to prioritize?,"My daughter is one year old, and it feels like everywhere I turn, there's some toxic or suspected toxic chemical in something she uses, wears, or eats.
Thinking about food, I know I can't afford (or necessarily want) to purchase and only feed her organic foods. I just can't research ""big juicy natural tomatoes"" for everything we eat. We eat out a decent amount, and I do Dinnerly boxes for meals a few times a week.
But the rest of the time - what should I prioritize? Should I focus on organic milk whence possible vs. Non-organic? Organic meats - is organic chicken more important than beef, or vice versa? Are there some meats that I can be less concerned about? What about fruits and veggies? Which ones should definitely be organic, and which ones are of less concern?
Are there other ""labels"" like non-gmo, farm-raised, etc, that you can provide some quality science- backed education on?

Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.', 'It‚Äôs been over 20 years, but I studied environmental toxicology for a few years until it got too depressing and I had to change my major.\nFrom what I recall, the area I would focus on first is bioaccumulation (meat and dairy). Many toxins accumulate in the food chain so the higher up in the food chain you eat, the higher the concentration of toxins. There is a very digestible explanation here: https://science4msratchford.weebly.com/uploads/3/9/8/3/39834479/pesticides_and_bioaccumulation.pdf. https://study.com/learn/lesson/bioaccumulation-concept-examples.html\nThis is also not about pesticides, but antibiotics are used with meat and dairy production. Plenty of research has linked this to antibiotic resistance. Organic guidelines restrict antibiotic used to it is actually medically necessary for the animal, so less antibiotics get used there. https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/limiting-antibiotic-use-in-farm-animals-will-help-reduce-antibiotic-resistance-201201104084\nAfter that I would look at what has skin that can be removed versus skin that cannot be removed on produce. Then I would look at lists that identify which types of produce contain the most dangerous concentrations of pesticides/herbicides. I see that many other commenters of already posted these list so you can choose from those.\nIf you have a farmers markets in your area, some organic farmers will have bins of ugly produce that is a fraction of the price of their beautiful produce. I have shopped bins like that for years to be able to eat organic and on a budget.', 'And this might not apply to OP, but maybe someone else in this sub: many farmers market stalls accept SNAP! You can send an email to the organizer of your local Farmers Market to get more info.', 'Also, as far as farmers markets go, many small farmers are not officially ‚Äúorganic‚Äù because it is too difficult/expensive to get certified, but they still use sustainable practices. Just talk to the farmers about it. If you join a farm CSA, it can help lower the costs a bit and make seasonal, clean produce more affordable and you‚Äôll know the details of how they run things.', ""As others have stated, organic/non gmo has no benefit over its counterpart. That‚Äôs all marketing. Moreover, organic does not = pesticide free. They just have to use ‚Äúorganic‚Äù pesticides (which can actually be more harmful than ‚Äúnon organic‚Äù pesticides, and/or used in higher quantities.)\nHere is a great read on organic vs non organic farming\nturns out that there are over 20 chemicals commonly used in the growing and processing of organic crops that are approved by the US Organic Standards. And, shockingly, the actual volume usage of pesticides on organic farms is not recorded by the government. Why the government isn't keeping watch on organic pesticide and fungicide use is a damn good question, especially considering that many organic pesticides that are also used by conventional farmers are used more intensively than synthetic ones due to their lower levels of effectiveness.\nIt has been assumed for years that pesticides that occur naturally (in certain plants, for example) are somehow better for us and the environment than those that have been created by man. As more research is done into their toxicity, however, this simply isn't true, either. Many natural pesticides have been found to be potential - or serious - health risks\nSo? Just wash your produce, whatever produce you‚Äôre using. There‚Äôs also nothing wrong with GMO farming. ‚ÄúBut they‚Äôll splice in squid genes into your apples!‚Äù someone will say. So? I eat squid, I eat apples, what‚Äôs wrong with having them mixed together? üòâ"", 'And as someone who knows - the GMO stuff is usually done to use LESS pesticides. As in, GMO corn has a gene added that is taken from a plant that repels certain weevils naturally. So GMO is actually both better for the environment and for you.\nAlso if you‚Äôve eaten any form of meat in the US, the animals have been fed this sort of corn. Almost 100% of the corn crop that is GMO is animal feed\nETA: GMO isn‚Äôt bad for you!! I don‚Äôt really know how it got that sort of reputation but essentially GMO is just the next step in evolution, solves the same or similar problems only faster.', 'Let\'s break down the factors: there\'s nutrition and there\'s toxins (pesticides, metals, bacteria, growth hormone, sex steroids, antibiotics). And let\'s talk about what it means for there to be nutritional differences and toxins, and what you can do about it.\nVarious studies have found that eating organic foods is associated with some beneficial health effects. But consumers who prefer organic food have healthier dietary patterns overall, which makes it hard to tell whether the beneficial effects are actually from food choices or from food nutrition.\nResults are conflicting on whether organic food is more nutritious than conventional food. This is probably because there are so many factors influencing the nutritive value. For example, if you feed a cow high-quality feed (organic or not) it will provide more nutritious milk. Cow breed and season and whether a farm is ""high-input"" (conventional) or ""low-input"" (conventional but less intensive) all affect the nutrition of the milk.\nOrganic foods do convey lower pesticide residue. The pesticides associated with disease. But the actual impact on human health (from the reduced levels in organic food) is not clear.\nIt is not clear whether bacteria and other toxins are any different between conventional and organic. Research finds similar levels of bacteria, but perhaps more antibiotic-resistant bacteria in conventional foods.\nSo science does not have evidence that eating organic foods directly reduces human disease in the long term (nor causes disease). But people who eat organic foods do have better diet and lower levels of obesity.\nMy opinion:\nIn my opinion you don\'t have to sweat choosing between organic vs conventional for a particular food item because the scientific evidence is not very strong. Instead, you should sweat trying to provide a diet rich in fruits, veggies, whole grains, and dairy. And you should wash your foods to reduce levels (but not eliminate) of pesticides and bacteria.\nIf you want to spend money to increase nutrition in foods it doesn\'t have to come from ""organic"" labels. You can get better nutrition from farms that provide better situations for their crops/animals. Farms that focus on quality will provide better nutrition foods regardless of whether they fully follow ""organic"" labeling requirements. So you can seek those out -- maybe they are organic, maybe not. They will be more expensive.\nIf you want to be ahead of the science and conclude on your own that the reduced pesticide level from organics actually does affect human health, then you can focus on items that have lower pesticides. Generally speaking, meats and dairy do not contain significant levels of pesticides, so buy conventional. For fruits and veggies, you would prefer organic. And within fruits and vegetables you can prioritize using the EWG pesticide list.\nSources:\nForman, Joel, et al. ""Organic foods: health and environmental advantages and disadvantages.""

Scientific literature supports that pesticide exposure is dangerous to neurodevelopment in fetuses and children. Higher blood levels of pesticides in pregnant women have shown higher rates of behavioral problems, ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, and lower IQ in their offspring. Higher urine pesticide levels in young children have demonstrated the same increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Buying organic certainly is not a guarantee to reduce pesticide exposure, but I do it whenever I can. I also don't spray my yard or house for bugs, and my dog gets an oral flea and tick preventative rather than topical to help reduce exposure. I don't live in an agriculture area, but this can also increase exposure.\nI highly recommend Rebecca Fett's book Brain Health From Birth.

Also, both the manufacturing site, and the ingredients must be non-gmo certified, so an all organic product that is co-manufactured at a facility that is not Non-GMO certified cannot be Non-GMO verified even though the product is organic.\nNow many brands are only showing non-gmo because people see this as almost equal to Organic, but it is not the same. In fact, some Non-GMO products might actually contain even more levels of pesticides because the product has not been genetically modified against pests.\nOrganic is the current gold standard. There are always attempts to water down the requirements, but it is still the top level. If you‚Äôre ever unsure, look into the brand in question. Cornucopia Institute and EWG are great sources for information.', 'Thank you. This is great information. My thought process was that Organic implies Non-GMO', 'The GMOs approved in America were developed to be resistant to a specific type of pesticide (eg 2,4-D resistant soybean, dicamba resistant corn). Producers buy the herbicide-resistant seed with the specific type of herbicide it is resistant to so they can spray a lot of the herbicide on the seed/crop without killing it. The increased use of herbicides on this herbicide-resistant crops negatively affect the surrounding environment, and this practice conflicts with the purpose of organic farming. For this reason, all organically grown food in the United States is non-gmo, by definition. If you see the little USDA organic label, you know it also means it‚Äôs non-gmo.\nSo yes, it‚Äôs a waste to get the non-gmo label in addition to the organic one because it‚Äôs redundant. However, I‚Äôve noticed that some foods just have the non-gmo label without the organic label, which means they could be grown with conventional pesticides, but a gmo-variety is not yet available. The list of approved gmos continues to grow, so I imagine these conventional crops would use gmos if they could.', 'It‚Äôs another label to make them look clean and healthy', '', 'No, you are incorrect. If a crop is certified organic (key word certified), GMO crops are strictly prohibited.', 'Well GMO varieties are going to be bred for high input growing environments, most likely engineered to withstand synthetic herbicide.\nSomething they will not get in an Organic system.\nTypically the seeds and chemicals are sold as a package,and no one would really grow GMO corn, canola or soy if they werent going to use their companion pesticides and fertilizers', ""NonGMO verified is stricter than organic, from what I've heard.\nFor example, imagine if GMO's were measured in ppm. Organic might allow 10ppm, but nonGMO verified might only allow 1ppm""]",https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/10fjq30/why_do_many_organic_food_products_have_nongmo/

The ways in which organic food differs to cheaper foods is often little to do with being organic and more to do with being higher quality.

Only nutters buy more ""organic"" things when the processing makes it objectively better (e.g. raw milk vs pasteurised milk).

And then there are fruits like oranges and bananas where you don't even consume the parts that might have had contact with pesticides or herbicides.\nThe USDA's National Organic Program was started in the 1990s as a way to sort of consolidate multiple regional standards. Like sometimes you'll still see the Oregon Tilth organic label. They've been around since the 1970s and are still in operation. Originally, a lot of small farmers viewed organic certification as a way to survive and compete against agribusiness corporations, and for a long time in the 1990s and early 2000s, that's sort of what organic generally was. Small farms that didn't use synthetic pesticides or herbicides, and conformed to several other regulations under the program. The organic food movement was originally as much about local ecology (preventing synthetic pesticide and herbicide runoff in local streams and rivers, etc) and supporting small farms as it was about human health.\nNow, buying organic you're just as likely buying it from a major agribusiness operation. They still have to conform to USDA regulations and submit to inspections to use the seal, so you'd still be supporting the use of fewer synthetic pesticides and herbicides, but it's a lot more difficult to know if you're buying from a small farmer or local farm. If you want to support small farms, the easiest way to do that is to buy from farmers markets or community supported agriculture delivery services. On a related note, if you want to buy organic dairy products, buy Stonyfield, which is produced by a cooperative network of small dairy farmers. Other brands like Horizon (which is almost always the same price) are major corporate dairy operations.""]",https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/11lvjed/which_nonorganic_food_is_worth_it_and_there_is_no/

Whew', 'Food Science Babe has great info on this topic', 'Yes, I was just going to mention The Food Science Babe! She literally changed my world view on food and farming and helped me to view food in a much more healthy way. She was kind enough to respond to me and that really opened my mind! Ps I‚Äôm an ex Health coach, so I initially bought into the organic/natural fallacy for many years.', 'I have a degree in sustainable agriculture and have worked on a lot of farms, so I can have some experience here. Organic is used to imply a lot more than it means. It has stopped really meaning ""good for the environment"" or even ""free of chemicals"" - there are all kinds of organic-approved pesticides/herbicides that are used on organic crops. GENERALLY speaking organic chemicals are better than non-organic chemicals for people/the environment, but a lot of people believe organic = no chemicals used when it\'s really just different chemicals.\nNot all dairy cows are treated with rBST hormones and some amount of rBST is natural (it is a naturally occurring hormone in cows). There\'s broad scientific consensus (among 56+ countries) that there is not health risks associated with the amount of rBST that ends up in milk from cows treated with it.\nA tangible difference in livestock farming is that you cannot use antibiotics in organic livestock. As someone who primarily has worked with livestock and plans to have my own, I think this sucks. People outside of ag hear this and think it\'s good, because no one wants antibiotics in their food - but any animal treated with antibiotics HAS to have a waiting period before they can be slaughtered or before eggs/milk can be collected for sale so that there are no antibiotics in the products. Conventional products do not have antibiotics in the edible product either. This sucks from a welfare standpoint - organic farmers essentially have to restrict themselves from using an effective medical treatment for their animals. This means things like culling would-be treatable animals, selling animals who need antibiotics to a different farm so they can be treated, or feeling forced to make choices that are not great for welfare, like playing ""wait and see"" with an infection, using less effective treatment, or using old wives tale-type remedies which may or may not help the animal at all.\nIt\'s not true that organic means LITERALLY nothing - there are a long list of strict regulations and getting certified is expensive (and thus not accessible for many smaller/new farms) - it\'s just that it typically doesn\'t mean what people think it does. Organic started as a response to very bad agricultural practices, but much of the practices it was born in response to have since been heavily regulated (antibiotics), or its grown to include things people still think it doesn\'t (chemicals).\nThere\'s no personal health difference between organic and conventional. It\'s mostly about how the practices impact the environment/animals.', 'Hopping onto this to point out that, to my understanding, fewer pesticides are not only better for the environment but also reduce harm to agricultural workers exposed to them', 'I view organic as less about personal health and more about planetary healthy. If I can afford it, I usually grab the organic.\nI think this is actually an issue I wish MP would cover - the idea of ‚Äúclean‚Äù eating is BS, but it does articulate with a broader environmental Movement that has shown there are toxins and carcinogens in our food supply. I‚Äôd love to tackle how to create political change for these issues in a way that does not draw on fatphobic/diet culture framings but still takes seriously the conditions which gave raise to these concerns.', 'There was an episode on Since VS. about organic food that was a fun listen.', '‚ÄúThe Food Science Babe‚Äù is an amazing resource for debunking the natural fallacy/organic farming.

Unfortunately, because of Canada\'s climate all food this time of year will be either imported or grown in green houses. Which, you are right, loses so much of the flavour because of the varieties that are grown are selected because they have a longer shelf life and have a ""look"" consumers want (as opposed to being selected because of the flavour). They are also are picked really prematurely and ripened off the plant so they can travel longer, which affects flavour.\nThis is true for most of the big grocery store food all year around. I personally haven\'t found any difference in taste of conventional vs organic veggies, but notice a difference in dairy and eggs.\nIn the summer, you can find better food at farmer\'s markets, but you\'ll be restricted to what is seasonally available.', 'You won‚Äôt find the same taste and flavours I can guarantee u that. Organic here isn‚Äôt the same', ""In Ontario, grocery stores have to tell you where the produce you're buying was grown. This will be either on the sign with the price or on the packaging or sticker. As the others have mentioned, looking for in season produce from Ontario is your best bet.\nThe next option is buying frozen fruits and veggies. They are picked at their prime and frozen. Not great for eating raw, but they work really well in cooking and baking. For example we only use frozen strawberries except for when they're in season locally as we find the imported stuff expensive and tasteless.\nAside from canned tomatoes, I can't speak to the quality of canned veggies, but I will say canned fruit does not have the same flavour as fresh fruit.\nCanned tomatoes are good for a lot of heavy tomato dishes (pastas, chilies) but we rarely use canned tomatoes for our Indian cooking (maybe others that can chime in here)\nThere are some fruits like bananas and mangos that you can buy from the grocery store but they will never taste as good as the ones from back home. Just accept this and indulge when you visit (or someone brings you a treat from their travels!).\nLastly, the stuff you find in the grocery store has been grown for specific characteristics to make it profitable to sell at grocery stores. They are grown to be durable during transportation, ripen off the plant, stay ripe longer and to look a certain way. You will rarely find tender leafy greens or delicate fruits because they are harder to transport or spoil quickly once picked. So definitely look into whether growing your own veggies in the spring and summer is a feasible endeavor as you'll have access to a wider range of foods. There are a few community gardens peppered throughout the city and if you have a balcony, container gardening may be an option."", 'Basically grow it yourself. Tastes so much better.', 'This.

There's farmers markets too."", 'Organic labeling is tightly controlled, if it says organic it‚Äôs organic. That being said, organic is mostly a marketing scheme, it makes no difference in flavours.\nHere in Canada we have a short growing season, so actual fresh, locally grown fruits and vegetables are only available for a month or so each year. If that particular fruit is not in season, it‚Äôs either going to have been shipped here from the southern US (mostly) or it will have been in storage.

101,"CMV: Organic food is better for health, the animals, and the environment","To caveat I mean ""better than non-organic"" when comparing the same products.
Another caveat, I acknowledge that ""organic"" is just a certification and you can have good farming practices without the certification. I'm saying that organic is at least a better guarantee of those practices. I'm also not saying ""organic is ALWAYS better than non-organic"", I more mean on the whole.
Ok so I always had this opinion but I'm starting to question it recently and want people to try and change my mind to move me better along that journey. The reasons I think/thought organic was better is because I've been under the impression that organic uses less/no artificial fertilizers or pesticides, have better standards for animal welfare, and generally uses farming practices that are less taxing on the environment.
If people could also nuance the difference between US organic and EU organic that would also be helpful.
For those trying to change my mind, please provide sources to all claims where possible. I'm the type of person who researches pretty thoroughly and likes reading through sources. I'm at the beginning of my research journey for this topic, but wanted to address Reddit first to get a bit of a head start.

A chunk of it goes back to Rudolf Steiner\'s ideas about astrology and mysticism impacting farming. A lot of it rests on the naturalistic fallacy that ""artificial"" is worse than ""natural"".\nLet\'s go through your three domains.\nHealth. Yes, a bunch of particular and popular pesticides and other chemicals used in farming have specific health risks. But note that there are pesticides approved for organic farming that just happen to be ""natural"". Particularly copper based pesticides which tend to be the most effective approved fungicide for organic crops. Copper when ingested is toxic to humans.\nAs far as other health benefits, organic produce and conventional produce tend to be pretty similar. There are a few incidental differences, and because small organic farms tend to grow more heirloom varieties, there may be differences there, but any advantage of an heirloom variety will come whether or not the farmer uses approved organic methods to grow it.\nAs for the animals. On this point you may be correct in a broad sense, but somewhat incidentally. The rules on things like antibiotics make it impossible for certified organic animal farming to really pack them in as tightly as conventional factory animal farms, which rely on those antibiotics to stem the infections that would inevitably result from those practices. And there are rules for things like exercise and access to space. That said, while the average organic certified farm may be a bit better than the average standard large factory farm- a local meat or dairy producer using humane old-school techniques is going to be giving the animals a better quality of life than either regardless of organic certification. If animal welfare is important to you, either abstaining from or minimizing animal product consumption or buying from a local small farm whose practices you know does A LOT more than buy organic certified in the grocery store.\nAnd finally the environment.\nOthers have touched on this, but there are tons of facets. The reality is that organic certification is profitable and most organic produce you\'ll see in stores is made by large farming companies who hopped on the trend and ride the line of certification as close as possible in every level where the certification gets in the way of profit margin. Most break the rules when they can get away with it, and ALL find those loopholes that meet the letter of the law but still have environmental impacts, like those copper based fungicides running off.\nAnd as others have said, one of the biggest environmental issues are greenhouse gas emissions. Organic is absolutely, 100% less efficient in production, measured either in land use, or labor. That lack of efficiency translates to more carbon used in the process.\nBut remember, methane from livestock is many times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon. And many methods of minimizing or capturing methane work with conventional farming methods, but not with organic methods.\nhttps://cen.acs.org/environment/climate-change/scientists-want-cut-livestocks-methane/100/i36\nAnd other methane solutions on the horizon rely on things like HMO crops in feed, also disallowed in organic certification.\nThis makes organic certified animal agriculture a big climate bomb that we don\'t have the tools to fix within organic regulations.', 'Thanks for the great reply. I\'m super close to giving a delta here but just want to follow up a bit on some things you said.\nHealth. Yes, a bunch of particular and popular pesticides and other chemicals used in farming have specific health risks. But note that there are pesticides approved for organic farming that just happen to be ""natural"". Particularly copper based pesticides which tend to be the most effective approved fungicide for organic crops. Copper when ingested is toxic to humans.\nVery interesting, do you have a source for this statement about copper usage in organic farming? Also do we end up consuming copper as a result or does the copper make it\'s way out by the time the food reaches us?\nIf animal welfare is important to you, either abstaining from or minimizing animal product consumption or buying from a local small farm whose practices you know does A LOT more than buy organic certified in the grocery store.\nDo you have any tips for figuring out what a good small local farm is? But yes, I am mostly pescatarian but my wife isn\'t the biggest fish person so we usually end up buying some pasture raised chicken or beef. Ironically, not certified organic but always look for the certified humane stickers.\nPretty convincing argument on the environmental front, how would you say the land use is an issue if organic farming (according to another commenter) uses less water per acre? Is it a deforesting issue or something else?', 'You recognize there isn‚Äôt an especially consistent definition of ‚Äúorganic‚Äù, correct?\nIt‚Äôs mostly marketing; US-EU labels try to put some parameters around it but it mostly just boils down to ‚Äòavoiding‚Äô some pesticides.\nEvery decision has pros and cons.\nA big one: intentionally opting out of higher efficacy farming techniques mean your crops have lower yields. Which means you need more land area and can‚Äôt feed as many people.\nNotably, the distinction between ‚ÄòGMO‚Äô and ‚Äònon gmo‚Äô is pretty arbitrary too. All of our crops have been selectively bred for so long before we understood genetics - they bear near zero resemblance to their ‚Äònatural‚Äô state.\nSuggesting ‚Äòpesticides are bad‚Äô is like‚Ä¶ okay but like ostensibly you must have some data on pesticides to your / environment health? Human health and lifespans have only increased since their introduction.', 'Organic food is better for health\nTo this point specifically, numerous studies have shown that organic produce, specifically, is functionally identical from a nutritional standpoint to non-organic produce.\nSome organic meats, particularly grassfed organic beef, is higher in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, but the same increase was found in non-organic grassfed beef, making the organic nature merely incidental to the health benefits.\nOrganic food is better for animals\nThis one is also highly predicated on the methods of farming used.\nTo be legally classified as ""organic"", meat animals must be fed a diet of certified organic feed and not treated with any added hormones, antibiotics, etc, and must have access to the outdoors.\nThe last bit would seem to support your claim that it\'s better for the animals, but in practice ""access to the outdoors"" usually means that each holding area for meat animals has one to two small doorways that allow access to a small plot of land (some as small as 10 ft x 10 ft)\nA chicken house filled with thousands of organic chickens has one to two doorways that chickens could walk out of to a small plot of open ground if they desired, but functionally results in almost no change to chicken living conditions.\nThe same is true for hogs raised for slaughter.\nOrganic cows, unless specifically classified as ""grass fed"", live identical lives to their non organic peers, just with organic instead of non-organic feed.\nOrganic food is better for the environment\nThat very much depends on the standard you\'re using.\nPer acre under cultivation, organic crops tend to use slightly less water, and of course don\'t use pesticides, etc, but that ignores the fact that you must plant significantly more acres of organic crops to get the same yield.\nFundamentally, organic crops require much larger land areas to produce the same amount of usable crop.\nMany would argue that limiting extremely high intensity farming to a significantly smaller land area is overall better for the environment.', ""Great reply thank you.\nCrops that are sprayed with chemical pesticides and fertilizers, eating them won't lead to any negative health outcomes as a result of those chemicals being present on the foods you're eating?\nOrganic crops you mentioned use more acres, but less water PER ACRE. So why would you say the increased use of land is bad environmentally speaking? Why would many argue that limiting high intensity farming to a significantly smaller land area is better for the environment?\nGreat point about animal welfare, although don't organic farms at least mandate some outdoor access while non-organic don't?"", ""There's not much more detail to give. I think the elimination / reduction of artificial / chemical pesticides and fertilizers leads to better health and environmental outcomes. For animal farming specifically I believe there are higher standards of animal welfare.\nCost isn't a factor in my belief."", ""There's no winning.\nOrganic vegetables take orders of magnitude more land to farm the same amount of food.\nSo sure, the RoundUp! isn't fucking with local verdibrates' hormone levels and making the frogs gay (yeah, that's what that meme was about) but you're cutting down more trees and clearing away more ecosystem just to produce the same amount of food."", 'I think you have to be more specific on what your view is as Organic could mean a whole lot to different people.\nFor example, does organic mean non-gmo? When speaking about animals do you mean ""organic"" meat raising or the impact of chemical on local biodiversity? Does organic mean to you ""no chemicals"" or the more accurate ""chemical use lower than X""?']",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/10nj08h/cmv_organic_food_is_better_for_health_the_animals/

The limiting factors are your pay zone set by corporate, that's why some of us see starting pay at $10 and others as high as $15 (I'm talking to you Montgomery county MD) and getting approved by the D.O. (not always required but mine likes to at least know about it)\nOther factors are things like making inventories in fresh and dry. No one gets in trouble when department miss but if every store misses and the company is missing a tens or hundreds of millions in missed inventory numbers, they take it somewhere else, i.e. limiting yearly raises, pushing back upgrading equipment, new initiative. I understand this sounds like I'm just feeding the same BS we all get but at the end of the day, however fucked up it is, this is how they do things.\nThe best thing you can do is self advocate, understand how much you are worth and for a few people, that you are ready for a new role.

161,Want to shout out a hidden gem of a North Jersey organic food joint: Fudgarten,"I spend a lot of time in Fort Lee and a few months ago I kept seeing this little ‚Äúfast casual organic eatery‚Äù place near Cafe Bene where I‚Äôd usually go for coffee. The outside of the eatery was really unassuming so I had passed it up until one day I was hankering to try something new and I remembered the place.
Boy, was I glad I went there! I had a burger with potato wedges and IDK what it is about how they cook it but it tasted so fresh almost like I was biting into steak instead of burger. There was a nice slight charred flavor, with guacamole and jalape√±os and a few other toppings that did not ‚Äúscream‚Äù in my face with crazy overpowering flavor but rather was quite light and pleasant on the palate. As weird as it is to use a term like ‚Äúrefreshing‚Äù to describe savory food, that‚Äôs the best way I can describe it. The burger was so fresh that I felt really good and light after eating it (as opposed to some places where I eat and feel bloated/sweaty).
Not sure if it‚Äôs their ingredients or what but Fudgarten has sandwiches and bowls and shakes and a whole host of other things I have yet to try. I usually hit them up like twice a month and it‚Äôs been very consistent. It describes itself as ‚Äúfast casual‚Äù and I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs close to that ‚Äî it‚Äôs a bit slower than say a Chipotle but it‚Äôs definitely not long like ordering at a sit-down restaurant.

So I've been baking Muesli for a smallish family owned business for a few months now that is going through a rough spot due to the spicy flu and their own personal stuff.
My issue is for a recipe I needed dried apple which had to come off an untouched pallet up high (got it down with a forklift). Looking close up the whole pallet was infested with these little bugs (looks similar to rust brown flour beetles), after opening some boxes we could see a lot of these bugs crawling through the apple. This pallet had been up there apparently since last year and from what I saw the best before was September last year.
Instead of throwing this out the boss put it all in chest freezers to kill the bugs and now we have to screen every box for bugs before putting it in the muesli. By screening I mean that we have to lay it out on a table and pick out the bugs. I tried to make the point that it won't guarantee that there won't be bugs in peoples food, to which the boss replied it's normal for organic food to have bugs in it.
When I tried talking about the quality of the bug infested apple and I'm not willing to eat the apple to test it's quality so why are we putting it in peoples food, I pretty much got a response of ""That's just your own mental feelings and thoughts about it, it's normal to have bugs in organic food"".

For those for whom this is also important - how do you guys deal with this when outside of US?

For example, in Austria and Italy, you can often find organic alternatives, e.g. organic pasta, chocolate, tomato sauce, cheese and so on.

When I lived in the UK I was always amused to see produce from South Africa in my local grocer long before anything from France.\nIt may be right that some European baseline standards are higher than US but most middle-income and above Americans aren‚Äôt buying cheap ingredients, and we‚Äôre also exporting a lot.\nNot a huge fan of local markets with no oversight, tbh.

Which, given Reddit\'s reputation for mostly having cheeto-munching shut-ins, doesn\'t surprise me. I also eat organic and have found it really hard to source food in many countries because of that. I will say Italy has banned Glysophate (here is a list of countries that banned Glysophate/Roundup: https://biodx.co/28-countries-ban-the-use-of-glyphosate-key-ingredient-in-roundup/#:~:text=The%20following%20countries%20have%20banned,%3B%20Oman%3B%20Qatar%3B%20St.) ) but unfortunately there\' s a huge difference between banning glysophate and having entirely organic food. IME the US is still far and away the leader in terms of having relatively accessible organic food- especially when you want to move into the realm of fun organic ""extras"" (like having organic chocolate, organic potato chips not fried in seed oils, etc). The US seems to lead the world, like most things, in food trends, so a lot of things we may take for granted in the US have not reached other countries yet (there\'s still heavy use of all kinds of seed oils in European organic goods, as well as lots of gluten/sugar). It\'s a sad revelation, realizing that most of the world has adopted toxic agricultural products.\nI have been able to find organic restaurants/stores when I\'m traveling, but it\'s often HEAVILY expensive, and you often have to check/double check labels or dictate to restaurants how you\'d like things cooked (i.e. offering to bring in butter so they can cook things in that). IME some of the worst places for this are in Eastern Asia, where pesticide use can be fairly widespread. For that reason I would not visit China and tend to avoid Chinese restaurants when in other Asian countries. I also try to avoid conventional food in Japan because they use lots of pesticides as well. I think some of the best bets for finding easy access to organic foods are going to places with other western expat ""woo woo"" types- places like Bali (although it\'s currently closed unless you\'ve had the vaccine), Costa Rica, or Thailand will probably have ample organic restaurants/stores because of the yoga types who frequent these places. You can eat a bit more conventional food in places like Italy and to a certain extent France, but of course they use other pesticides, just not as much. There are also great restaurants in various places around the world where they will grow produce at their home and then cook it in the restaurant. But it definitely takes time and research and to a certain extent these are ""first world issues"" (as you can see from the bizarrely hostile responses in this thread) that a lot of people dont take seriously whatsoever. Many in other countries have a lot greater fish to fry and so worrying about organic produce sadly isnt even on their list of priorities. But yeah, unfortunately it\'s just an issue of doing a lot of research before you go places. I\'d say for a lot of countries, you\'re going to find a much greater percentage of organic stores in large cities than in small towns, so i it matters a lot to you, stick to the big, world class cities. Still, it probably will not compare to the abundance of fantastic organic options we have in the USA, especially in cities like Los Angeles.\nSorry for the wall of text but this is something I worry about a lot to and havent had a great solution either.

But researcher John DeLong at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln wanted to find out if any microbes actively ate viruses, and whether such a diet could support the physiological growth of individuals and the population growth of a community.\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôre made up of really good stuff: nucleic acids, a lot of nitrogen and phosphorous,‚Äù said DeLong. ‚ÄúEverything should want to eat them. So many things will eat anything they can get ahold of. Surely something would have learned how to eat these really good raw materials.‚Äù\nTo test the hypothesis, DeLong and his team collected samples of pond water, isolated different microbes, and then added large amounts of chlorovirus, a freshwater inhabitant that infects green algae. Over the next few days the team tracked the population size of the viruses and the other microbes to see if the latter was eating the former.\nAnd sure enough, one particular microbe seemed to be snacking on the viruses ‚Äì a ciliate known as Halteria. In water samples with no other food source for the ciliates, Halteria populations grew by about 15 times within two days, while chlorovirus levels dropped 100-fold.

235,The importance of diet (organic food) and exercise,"For the past week I have been away on holiday. This may sound insignificant, however the resort I have been staying at brands itself around only supplying organic food. Furthermore, even the hygienic products they supply are all organic (e.g soap, shampoo etc). The water is all glass bottled spring water too, which I believe may be relevant as most tap water has some form of contaminants in it‚Ä¶
Furthermore, due to the fact it is an all inclusive resort, I have found myself eating a full 3 meals a day to get my moneys worth, which is usually unheard of for me as I have anhedonia and thus don‚Äôt feel hunger. I have also been exercising much more through being in the sea/swimming pool a lot and swimming/treading water works your muscles and heart much more than you would imagine.
Anyway, the reason I believe this is so significant is that, despite not being a miracle cure and diminishing all my other symptoms (anhedonia, muscle weakness, brain fog), it has definitely noticeably improved my libido. I don‚Äôt find myself actively obsessing about sex and having an unstoppable sex drive like I used to, however I‚Äôve found that simply seeing attractive people caused semi erections and even slight touch will set off a reaction as it were.
Therefore I encourage all of you to try and eat as healthily and as much as possible, and try to do some exercise, especially anything that gets your heart going as the healthier you heart is, the more efficiently it pumps blood around the body.
